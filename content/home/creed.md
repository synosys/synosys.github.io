SynoSys is Complexity Science. The spirit and perspectives that Complexity Science offers pervades the Center, its people, and their activities. We investigate phenomena that seem unrelated at first glance, we seek and search for underlying rules that connect them. We have an anti-disciplinary attitute, we are neo-generalists, we trespass the borders of traditional disciplines. We explore, we do science with a compass, rather than a map. 
We get lost in science.
