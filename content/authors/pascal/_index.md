Pascal is a physicist by training with a PhD in biophysics and an interdisciplinary interest with a focus on multi-agent systems and human mobility.
How simple interaction rules shape the large scale dynamics of a system is the unifying question behind a diverse set of projects as human mobility and epidemics, fungal growth, prey collective avoiding a predator, and opinion dynamics on adaptive networks.
