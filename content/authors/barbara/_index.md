Barbara started her PhD journey in January 2024. She joint this workgroup for her master's project, where she explored ecological consumer-producer networks resembling gut microbiomes and analysed their conditions for structural stability . Previously, she contributed to a project developing a compressed sensing method for an optical near-field microscope, focusing on sampling methods that balance reconstruction quality and measurement stability.
