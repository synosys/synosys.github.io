Frank Schlosser studies human mobility and its connection to epidemic spreading. He is currently leading the research group of the Covid-19 mobility project, where we use mobile phone data to monitor mobility during the pandemic in Germany.
Frank has a background in Physics, and loves to understand and model any complex system using maths and data.
