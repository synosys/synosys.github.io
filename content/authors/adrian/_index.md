Adrian is a PhD student at the Humboldt University Berlin, affiliated with the Technische Universität Dresden and formerly the Robert Koch Institute. His research is focussed on the evolution of clonal populations in networks and the interplay of spreading processes and evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, Adrian is particularly interested in the role of  global human mobility patterns in the evolution of diseases.
