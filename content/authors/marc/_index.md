Marc joined the group during the Corona pandemic in Mid 2020 as a PostDoc and
Data Scientist. He is a theoretical physicist by training and has widespread
interest and experience in the development of novel methods for time series
analysis, data visualization and the reduction of large-scale system properties
to core principles. He is involved in predictive modeling tasks for the Corona
Datenspende as well as exploratory analyses of anomalous patterns in the
COVID-19 Mobility Project.
