abstract: "In November 2021, the first infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.529 (‘Omicron’) was reported in Germany, alongside global reports of reduced vaccine efficacy (VE) against infections with this variant. The potential threat posed by its rapid spread in Germany was, at the time, difficult to predict. We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered infectious-disease model that included information about variant-specific and waning VEs based on empirical data available at the time. Compared to other approaches, our method aimed for minimal structural and computational complexity and therefore enabled us to respond to changes in the situation in a more agile manner while still being able to analyze the potential influence of (non-)pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the emerging crisis. Thus, the model allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs), the efficacy of contact reduction strategies, and the success of the booster vaccine rollout campaign. We expected a large cumulative number of infections with the VOC Omicron in Germany with ICU occupancy likely remaining below capacity, nevertheless, even without additional NPIs. The projected figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid-February and mid-March. Most surprisingly, our model showed that early, strict, and short contact reductions could have led to a strong ‘rebound’ effect with high incidences after the end of the respective NPIs, despite a potentially successful booster campaign. The results presented here informed legislation in Germany. The methodology developed in this study might be used to estimate the impact of future waves of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases."
