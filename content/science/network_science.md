Network science pervades our research. It offers new perspectives on many complex systems in biology, social science and technology. Network science can reveal hidden structures in complex systems and, more importantly, point out similiarities beween systems that may seem unrelated at first glance and identify universalities and fundamental design principles. Network science plays a key role in our research on human mobility, infectious disease dynamics, and computational social science.
