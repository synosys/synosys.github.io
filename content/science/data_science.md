Most of what we do at SynoSys is based on data. We share an affection for large scale, heterogeneous datasets obtained in natural experiments, so data that was **not** generated with a scientific intention but rather as a byproduct of typically digital technologies, like cell phones, individual mobility patterns, online platforms, social media and citizen science projects. In data science we emphasize the explorative nature of science. Metaphorically speaking, we do data sciences without a map - just with a compass, curiosity and intuition.
