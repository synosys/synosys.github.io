SynoSys is not only about bridging gaps between traditionally disconnected scientific disciplines. We are also about removing barriers between the scientific community and the public. Digital technologies of today permit the creating of citizen science projects and citizen science experiments in which citizens contribute in large scale data donation projects, engage in the scientific discourse, participate on all levels in the knowledge creating process. A good example is the Corona Data Donation Project which we launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.
