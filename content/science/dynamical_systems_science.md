Almost all systems we investigate at SynoSys are dynamic. We are interested in complex dynamical systems, e.g. the spread of infections in a population, evolutionary processes, behavior and adaptation, collective behavior, pattern formation, to name a few. Unsurprisingly, dynamical systems science is a core methodological area at the center. Particularly in conjunction with network science we are trying to understand the connection between network structures and their imprint on dynamical phenomena that are driven by them.
