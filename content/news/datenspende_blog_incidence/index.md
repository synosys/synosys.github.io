summary: "In our recent analysis of data collected in the Corona Data Donation Project, we compared the officially reported cases of COVID-19 with what we obtain by self-reporting and surveys launched in the Data Donation Project. In a nutshell we found that both incidences coincide until April/May 2022. At that time both quantities started deviating substantially."
