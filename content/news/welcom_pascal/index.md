Pascal is a physicist by training with a PhD (almost) in biophysics and an interdisciplinary interest with a focus on multi-agent systems. How simple interaction rules shape the large scale dynamics of a system is the unifying question behind diverse projects as predator avoidance in collective behavior and opinion dynamics on adaptive networks. He joined our team during the Corona pandemic in March 2021.

In our team Pascal will expand our COVID-19 modeling efforts. He will also dive into the data analytics projects. 

We are very happy that Pascal will be joining us soon.
