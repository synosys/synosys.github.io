You can find the whole report here: [** -> Traffic in the Pandemic by Distance <- **](https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/reports/adjacent-travel/) 

In past reports we have shown repeatedly that the change in mobility during the pandemic affects local and long-distance traffic differently. Recently, there has been increased interest in traffic-by-distance, as actual and proposed policies like the “15-km rule” have targeted long-distance travel to limit the spread from COVID-19 hotspots to neighboring areas and beyond. This report explores **how much traffic remains local**, **how much crosses borders**, and **how drastic regional differences are**.

The report can be [found on the covid-19-mobility monitor site](https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/reports/adjacent-travel/) but is also available as an [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@adrianzachariae/traffic-in-the-pandemic-by-distance).
