Finally, **"Im Wald vor lauter BÃ¤umen - unsere komplexe Welt besser verstehen"** is now out and available. 

This popular scientific book explains the science of Complexity, how it works, what anti-disciplinary science looks like and what benefits are gained by connecting different phenomena observed in traditionally distant scientific disciplines. 

The book captures topics such as:

- complex networks
- synchronization
- critical phenomena
- tipping points
- the emergence of cooperation

and illustrates the connections between these phenomena using various examples from biology, ecology and social science.

The book is in German.

More information, also in German is available [**here**](https://www.dtv.de/buch/dirk-brockmann-im-wald-vor-lauter-baeumen-28299/).
