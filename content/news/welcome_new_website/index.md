Dear friends,

Today is a good day. A rare statement these days. I am happy to announce that – as of today – we have a new website. You are on it.

A step that was long overdue. After three years of stagnation, a dysfunctional, ugly and chaotic website, and numerous complaints we finally managed to kick-off a better interface to the community, students and the public.

At the moment, our site contains the bare minimum of information. Essentially you'll find information on our publications and our research projects and activities. 

Most importantly you can have a look at our team. 

The site still isn't where it's supposed to be. A number of elements are still missing. A bunch of publications still need to be added (especially older ones) and we need to add additional projects that we have done in the past for reference.

### What's next?

There are other things I'd like to add to the website. All my course material of the past will be added. I'm also thinking about a segment on interactive visualizations, video clips, an artwork gallery, and some other stuff. In due time.

We will see how much of it we will actually be able to implement. We'll keep you posted here.
