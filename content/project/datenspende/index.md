title: Corona Datenspende App
summary: At the beginning of April 2020, we launched the official Corona Datenspende App. Since then, more than 530.000 German inhabitants have decided to donate their fitness tracker data. This is the biggest data donation project worldwide. We also calculate daily fever detections by regions and update the live fever monitor.
