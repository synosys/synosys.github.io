summary: "The **Covid-19 Event Horizon Project** was inititated during the onset of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 when the pandemic was predominantly unfolding in mainland China. The project had two independent elements, each containing a predictive model. One model assessed the import risk of SARS-CoV-2 in different countries based on the global air-transportation network. The second dynamical model (SIRX) assessed the contaiment measures on the dynamics of the time course of the pandemic."
