title: Epipack
summary: "Fast prototyping of epidemiological models based on reaction equations. Analyze the ODEs analytically or numerically, or run/animate stochastic simulations on networks/well-mixed systems. Simple compartmental models of infectious diseases are useful to investigate effects of certain processes on disease dissemination. Using pen and paper, quickly adding/removing compartments and transition processes is easy, yet the analytical and numerical analysis or stochastic simulations can be tedious to set up and debugâ€”especially when the model changes (even slightly)."
