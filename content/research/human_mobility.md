A number or research projects at SynoSys revolve around human mobility and mobility network analysis. We are interested in disentangling hidden structures in mobility networks, how structural features in mobility networks impact dynamical processes that evolve on them, e.g. how structures in the global air-transportation network shape how pandemics spread across the globe and how mobility network structures respond to disruptions and change over time.
