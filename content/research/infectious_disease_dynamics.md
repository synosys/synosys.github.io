The dynamics of infectious diseases has been one of our key research interests for the past two decades. During the COVID-19 pandemic we were very busy in this area. We develop large scale models for spread of infectious diseases, especially on a global scale, and focus on closing the loop between contagion dynamics -> information dynamics -> behavioral responses. In this context we devote a lot of effort to measuring relevant behavioral responses using digital tools, cell phones, pervasive data, and data obtained in natural experiments.
