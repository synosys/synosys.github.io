Digital epidemiology is an active and growing research area at SynoSys. We have designed and implemented several digital projects in the area of epidemiology and public health, ranging from a nationwide mobility monitor to assess behavioral responses to changes in the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, the launch of the Corona Data Donation Project in which more than 500.000 participants donated more than two years of data collected on wearable their fitness trackers and smart watches, to studies of the effects of digital tracing apps in the context of COVID-19. Currently we are focusing on the use of wearable devices to improve our understanding of Long- and Post-COVID.
