During COVID-19, our research was dominated by the pandemic. The research ranged from 
modelling the global spread on the worldwide air-transporation network and import risk for different countries and regions during the early phase of the pandemic, modelling the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the impact of digital contact tracing, and various digital epidemiology projects. We now focus on understanding phenomena in the aftermath of the pandemic, particulary Long- and Post-Covid Conditions. The foundation of this research is the massive data
collected in the Coronal Data Donation Project.
