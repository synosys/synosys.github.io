Recently we started exploring mechanisms of cooperative phenomena in biological and social systems. We are particularly interested in the emergence of cooperative behavior among unlike
entities, cooperation as a driver for innovation and selection processes beyond concepts of species and individuals. Using methods from network science and dynamical systems science we investigate entangled evolutionary processes, structural stability of ecological networks and how cooperation may make systems more robust.
