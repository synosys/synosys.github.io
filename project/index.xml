      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major milestone for us: We have been awarded €2.3 million in funding from the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) for the SynoSys.PC project, aimed at advancing the understanding of Long-COVID and advancing patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By harnessing high-resolution wearable data and applying methods from network science, data analytics and AI, SynoSys, in collaboration with the University Hospital Jena, seeks to develop innovative approaches and gain significant insights to the underlying mechanisms of Long-Covid and Post-Covid-Condition (PCC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project builds on one of the largest datasets of its kind, with high-resolution individual time series of wearable data, e.g. heart rate, physical activity and sleep from more than 500,000 participants. Key goals include identifying wearable-based indicators of persistent symptoms and establishing an open competence center to drive the integration of digital technologies into health research and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project represents a significant leap toward leveraging digital health tools and smart technologies for public health. SynoSys is proud to be at the forefront of shaping the future of healthcare and we are super excited to start pushing the envelope in this area.

      <title>Spatiotemporal Organization of Sleep</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/spatiotemporal-sleep-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/spatiotemporal-sleep-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We perform comprehensive spatiotemporal analyses of sleep patterns in a sample of over 100,000 individuals across Germany spanning almost 3 years. As part of the Robert Koch Institute&amp;rsquo;s Data Donation Project for the early detection of COVID-19, sleep data, in conjunction with heart rate and activity data, was collected in a privacy-preserving fashion by passive sensors in consumer wearable devices from April 2020 until December 2022, yielding more than 45 million nights of sleep observations overall. Sleep tracking studies for the first time enable a means of large-scale, real-time, non-invasive, continuous, longitudinal objective sleep measurements at a relatively low-cost with high accessibility. This combination of long observation period, and high temporal and spatial resolution is ideally suited to track sleep behavior over time, enabling the identification of robust seasonal trends as well as fine-grained analyses of short-term changes. The large number of regular participants from all over Germany allows for spatial analyses in a highly-resolved manner to discern complex patterns along geographical position or population density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&#34;margin-top: 0;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/sleep.html&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;Full&#34;/&gt; --&gt;
 &lt;iframe src=&#34;./sleep.html&#34; width=&#34;1000px&#34; height=&#34;795px&#34; margin-top=&#39;0&#39; style=&#34;border:none;&#34; overflow:hidden;&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Spatiotemporal analyses of sleep behavior have great informative value for public health. Mapping sleep patterns is essential to understanding which external conditions pose risks for sleep, which ones may be protective, and how these conditions interact. The two main conditions that we focus on are in constant conflict with each other in our modern lives: - Sun time (or solar time) refers to the natural time structure on Earth based on the position of the sun in the sky, which gives rise to the timing and duration of day and night as well as the seasons. - Social time (or societal time) refers to the human-constructed timing framework, shaped by policy and social forces, that determines weekly structure, work and school schedules, time zone allocation and adherence to daylight saving time.
&lt;p&gt;Individual aspects of this interaction of sun and social time on sleep and circadian rhythms have been investigated in numerous studies to date. These studies range from small diary studies and detailed physiological studies in small but high-quality samples to large questionnaire-based studies, with studies based on wearable sensor data in larger samples a most recent addition. Their seemingly conflicting results on the relative contribution of social and sun time and the seasonality of human sleep highlight the complexity of the matter at hand. Moreover, it indicates the biological and epidemiological insights that may be gleaned from assessing systematic patterns in sleep with season, weekly structure and geographical position to pinpoint vulnerable populations and effective countermeasures where sun and social time conflicts may lead to unfavorable sleep outcomes and risks for acute and long-term health and safety may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Corona Data Donation project, we were able to assess many of the social and solar attributes of sleep for the first time together in one large, longitudinal data set of objective sleep phenotypes. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of passive sensing for monitoring and understanding trends in public health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clonal Interference in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/clonal_interference/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/clonal_interference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our research group explores the intricate relationship between complex environmental structures and evolutionary processes, focusing on clonal interference in asexual populations. We aim to understand how organisms adapt in heterogeneous, network-like environments that closely resemble real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clonal interference (CI) occurs in asexual populations when multiple beneficial mutations arise and compete, unable to combine through recombination. While CI has been studied in well-mixed or simple spatial structures, its behavior in complex, heterogeneous environments remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;optional_cool.gif&#34; alt=&#34;cool gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Research Aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding CI in Highly Heterogeneous Environments: We investigate how diverse network topologies influence clonal interference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying Key Structural Components: We aim to pinpoint specific elements of network structures that significantly impact adaptive processes, understanding which features promote faster adaptation and which areas are likely sources of adaptive mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaping and Controlling Adaptive Evolution: By understanding how network structures influence evolution, we seek to develop strategies for potentially guiding adaptive processes in complex environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing Analytical Tools: We&amp;rsquo;re working to create and refine mathematical and computational tools that effectively model and predict evolutionary dynamics in intricate systems, bridging network theory, evolutionary biology, and complex systems science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights gained from our research have potential applications across a wide range of fields. In epidemiology, our understanding of how pathogens evolve in structured host populations could form more effective disease management strategies. Conservation biologists might use our findings to guide habitat management practices, supporting species adaptation and resilience in fragmented environments. Our work could also lead to improved bioprocess designs by accounting for how environmental structure affects microbial evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these direct applications, the principles we uncover might have broader, more speculative implications. For instance, our approaches to mutation spread in biological networks could provide insights into how content goes viral on social media platforms with diverse user structures. The competition between genetic strains in our research might elucidate how ideas, innovations and cultural practices propagate through social and professional networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to explore the intricate interplay between network complexity and evolutionary dynamics, we&amp;rsquo;re not merely advancing theoretical knowledge. We&amp;rsquo;re developing a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how adaptation occurs in complex systems. This research has the potential to open new avenues for managing and harnessing evolutionary processes in various fields, spanning from biology to the social sciences. By bridging the gap between network theory and evolutionary biology, we&amp;rsquo;re paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of how information – be it genetic, cultural, or technological – spreads and competes in our interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19 Detection from Wearables</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/covid_detection/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/covid_detection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Controlling the spread of infectious diseases early in a pandemic is crucial. The recent COVID-19 outbreak and its rapid global spread highlight the urgent need for tools that can limit the spreading of infectious diseases at the earliest stage possible to prevent global pandemics.
Previous research has suggested the potential to detect COVID-19 infections through the observation of physiological alterations occurring after the onset of the disease, including elevated resting heart rates, extended sleep durations, and decreased physical activity. Wearable sensors, equipped to monitor these changes, in conjunction with machine learning algorithms trained on data from these sensors, could identify these variations, thus providing a method to quickly classify individuals as infected.
Utilizing wearable sensor data from the Corona Data Donation Project, which encompasses resting heart rate, step count, and sleep duration time series from over 120,000 voluntary participants, a Logistic Regression model was developed for the classification of submitted COVID-19 test results. This model achieved classification success, as evidenced by a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.58, precision of 0.26, and recall of 0.54. The implementation of the catch22 feature set for feature extraction from the submitted wearable sensor data enhanced the interpretability of the classification algorithm. It also enables a more detailed analysis of the specific physiological changes used to differentiate individuals testing positive or negative for COVID-19.
This study emphasizes the capability of predicting COVID-19 across large cohorts and underscores the value of employing infectious disease prediction models based on wearable sensor data as an additional public health tool.
&lt;strong&gt;The LR model presented in Fig. 1 demonstrated&lt;/strong&gt; prediction capabilities for COVID-19 test results surpassing random chance, thereby facilitating the early detection of this infectious disease. Additionally, the incorporation of catch22 features into the feature engineering process enhanced the interpretability of the classification decisions made by the model.
The predictive LR model shown in Fig. 1 demonstrated satisfactory performance, notable given the voluntary nature of data submission, the impossibility of verifying correct and constant wear of devices, reliance on daily averages, absence of precise test and symptom onset dates, and the utilization of multiple devices across a broad cohort. The present study introduced a predictive model that has been trained on a considerable cohort size, addressing concerns from existing research about models only trained on significantly smaller cohorts. Additionally, this study tackled the issue of geographic underrepresentation by developing a predictive model for COVID-19 classification with data donated outside the United States, addressing other concerns in existing literature.
Additionally confirmatory models have been developed which showed performances consistent with existing literature, validating its efficacy in confirming COVID-19 infections within this study’s framework. Enhancements in confirmatory capability were noted with the increasing days included after a COVID-19 test submission, indicating that a longer observational period bolsters the model’s confirmatory power. Employing interpretable catch22 feature engineering provided clarity in the classification process and verified that the detected signals coincide with physiological responses to COVID-19 infection, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. This consistency in signal detection across the models and their alignment with other research accentuates the catch22 features’ ability to accurately capture vital data signals from wearable sensor data. Conclusively, this study proposes a combined approach of catch22 feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms as an effective strategy in combating the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Highlighting that this methodology could be particulary valuable in the initial stages of a pandemic, where traditional methods might be unavailable. Thus, it offers an essential addition to public health resources. This study stresses the potential of utilizing wearable sensor data, combined with automated feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms, for the detection and confirmation of diseases like COVID-19. With additional advancements machine learning approaches to detect illnesses like COVID-19 using wearable sensor data could significantly improve the readiness and response to future public health crise&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FEDORA Project Secures Funding to Explore Post-COVID Ecological Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/fedora/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/fedora/</guid>

      <title>Fungal Growth</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fungi interact in a mycorrhizal symbiosis with plants or are simple decomposers of organic matter.
In this project, we investigate the growth of filamentous fungi by creating and investigating mathematical growth models.
We cooperate with experimental biologists from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aguilar-ecology.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;aguilar ecology lab&lt;/a&gt; who have a profound knowledge of the growth patterns of different fungal species (see Fig.1).
In a first &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ismecommun/article/2/1/2/7460968&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;network analysis of our collaborators&lt;/a&gt;, they identified that some network traits vary most in between species, as for example the meshedness (how different the network is from a fully-connected one without crossing edges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/2022Aguilar_network_paper_fig3adapted.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.1 - Different species of hyphal growing fungi and the reconstruction of the network they are forming.
  Figure is adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ismecommun/article/2/1/2/7460968&#34;&gt;Aguilar-Trigueros et al. (2022)&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We address the problem from a modeling perspective, that means we build an agent-based model, which is motivated from real fungi.
In our model each agent represents the tip of a hyphen and the tip as well as the whole hyphen release an enzyme.
This enzyme diffuses though the environment and other tips/agents can sense the local concentration and gradient.
This is all the information the tip has about its environment, i.e. only local information is allowed.
New Tips/Agents are created either by an apical branching event, at which one tip splits in two, or by a lateral branching event, where from the lower half of a tip compartment multiple branches grow perpendicular to the local growth direction.
By varying some fundamental parameters of the model as the diffusion coefficient, the enzyme release rate or the number of lateral branches, different shapes can emerge as shown if Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/3_mycel_compilation.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;1200&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.2 -
  Depending on the parameters, the mycelium grows densely (A) or less densely (B, C) if for example the enzyme release rate is increased (B)  or the septation rule is adapted (C). The enzyme in the environment (orange and red background color) inhibits the growth of the mycelium, thus the mycelium is more responsive to its own form (compare A with B). In (A, B) the septation and lateral branching form always two septa and branches at each septation event. In (C) 6 septa and branches are formed during a septation event. While the quadrants 2-4 show the concentration on a variable linear scale (bottom color bar), the 1st quadrant uses a fixed logarithmic scale (top color bar) to enable a fair comparison between simulations.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goals are now to reproduce key structural properties of real fungal species with a model as simple as possible, study the statistical properties of the different phases of the model and what task the fungi can perform beast at every phase.
This is exciting, especially because we are able to switch between theory, modelling and experiments.
The big picture is of course the role of the fungi in the ecosystems in connection with their growth strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Import Risk</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/import_risk/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/import_risk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our globalized world is strongly connected, on the small scale by buses, trains, cars, and on the largest, global scale by the Worldwide Air transportation Network (WAN).
It is likely that our connectivity has not reached its peak yet, since for example the number of globally scheduled air passengers increased yearly by about 6% between 2004 and 2019.
The connectivity has immense consequences on the propagation of disease since alongside passengers everything that sticks to them, such as bacteria, viruses, earth clumps beneath their shoes etc. comes with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project crosses the fields of network science, transportation, mobility and disease dynamics and it&amp;rsquo;s an offspring of the idea to not use the conventional distance (in meter, miles, feet &amp;hellip; pick your unit) as a metric but an &lt;strong&gt;effective distance&lt;/strong&gt; that is based on the mobility between regions.
When - $P(B | A)$ is the probability to travel to B from A (which is computed from mobility fluxes) than the effective distance is $ d _{\text{eff}} (A | B) = d_0 - log (P(i| n_0)) $ -.
In the seminal paper by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brockmann and Helbing (2013)&lt;/a&gt; _effective distance $d _{\text{eff}}$ - was shown to linearly correlate with the arrival time of diseases as shown in Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/eff_dist_paper_adapted_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;Full&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 2 - The shortest path tree based on the &lt;b&gt;effective distance&lt;/b&gt; with the airport of Hong Kong as origin (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and how a pandemic spreads around the globe (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;).
  While the spread on the world map seems rather random, you see a nice circular wave spreading in the effective distance tree, illustrating the linear correlation to disease arrival times.
  Adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200&#34;&gt;Brockmann and Helbing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recent paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser et al. (2024),&lt;/a&gt; we deepen the connection between the effective distance shortest path tree, spreading dynamics and mobility.
We present a way to estimate the passenger flow between any two airports (including those without direct connections) given that we only know the number and maximal capacity of planes (see illustrative example in Fig. 3).
In the end, the method allows us to estimate the number of infected passenger leaving B when we know the number of infected that entered A.
Thus, we know the risk of importation and why it is named &lt;b&gt;import risk method&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/relrisk.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 3 - Import Risk Example: 100 infected passengers board planes at airport X en route to destination airports elsewhere in the network, going through transit airports in the process. The relative import risk at a given destination is the fraction of the 100 individuals that entered at airport X and exited at that destination airport (red).
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic idea behind the import risk method is to let a random walker start at node B of the WAN and exit at each node with a probability derived from the effective distance shortest path tree.
The final fraction of times it leaves at node A is the import risk probability.
Now, this method is parameter free and motivated by disease dynamics, but at the same time it provides a method to estimate mobility on a global scale.
The mobility estimation is a classic task in transportation science with well-established models as the gravity model (proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2087063?casa_token=5goDmVg4aOkAAAAA%3A6Y9zup7UcSjT8DQ1izhRza_-N568nGLP_43ikQys0Vzoux-4qaYKp1u0Cruz2YwZ2hggPU2PIKW4oqbB6xnFtaJIgj-oX_zCbMwLneoPv8OzCdsFXA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1946 by Zipf&lt;/a&gt;).
A core aspect of our import risk paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser et al. (2024)&lt;/a&gt; is to compare our method to established mobility models.
We found that our approach outperforms the established models, and the crazy thing is, that our method is parameter free, while the gravity model always needs parameter estimation (one needs to know the real mobility flow beforehand).
This holds true if we check the prediction quality for the 10 countries with the highest import probability, which is especially important for disease propagation since these countries are the one that should increase their passenger control (shown in Fig. 4).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/ir_paper_fig_10cntrs.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 4 - Mobility model comparisons for top 10 import countries: The well-established gravity model with exponential (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and power-law (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) distance decay, the parameter free radiation model (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;) and our import risk model (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;).
  Each dot is a country that is among the 10 countries with the highest import probability from another country (10 target countries x 183 source countries).
  A true or false positive (T.Pos. or F. Pos.) means that the country is or is not among the 10 countries with the highest reference import probability.
  A false negative (F. Neg.) means that it belongs according to reference it is among the top 10 but was not detected by the respective model.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied the measure during COVID-19 to estimate the countries that have been reached by Omicron without it being detected &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/reports/importrisk_omicron_update/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
And in a big cooperation with great colleagues that have been put together by &lt;a href=&#34;https://manliodedomenico.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manlio De Domenico,&lt;/a&gt; we have developed and validated a framework (&lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/6/pgad192/7191545?login=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser and d&amp;rsquo;Andrea et al. (2023)&lt;/a&gt;)that can estimate from sparse and noisy samples via phylogenetic analysis the time when the variant first occurred in the country of origin, how it spreads across the globe with our import risk model, and how the countries are affected by a disease dynamic model.
We were even able to smash everything into one number, which we call the &lt;strong&gt;pandemic delay&lt;/strong&gt;, that estimates how long it takes for a new emerging variant to make out 10% of all current cases in a respective country.
It revealed that only by combining mobility data with a phylogenetic estimate of the reproduction number, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly
assessed relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a pandemic develops depends on many factors: the biology of the pathogen, its susceptibility to external influences such as humidity and temperature, but most of all it is determined by contacts between individuals: transmissions occur primarily when people have contact with each other. The number of contacts thus gives us an insight into the course of the pandemic. Fewer contacts make it more difficult for the pathogen to spread through the population, whereas more contacts promote rapid spread. In the Contacts Monitor, we show the number of contacts and its variation in Germany over time.&lt;/p&gt;
