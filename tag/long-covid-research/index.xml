We are thrilled to announce that SynoSys has been awarded €2.3 million in funding from the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) for the innovative **SynoSys.PC project**. This pioneering initiative aims to revolutionize our understanding of Long-COVID and improve patient care through cutting-edge technology and research.

The **SynoSys.PC project** focuses on leveraging high-resolution wearable data, network science, data analytics, and AI to uncover the mechanisms behind Long-COVID and Post-COVID-Condition (PCC). With one of the largest datasets of its kind, including time series data from over 500,000 participants, our goal is to identify wearable-based indicators of persistent symptoms and establish an open competence center for integrating digital technologies into health research and care. --&gt;
&lt;!-- ### Key Highlights:

- **Collaboration with University Hospital Jena**
- **High-resolution time series data from 500,000+ participants**
- **Focus on wearable-based indicators for Long-COVID symptoms**
