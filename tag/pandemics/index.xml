      <title>New paper out: Germany’s fourth COVID-19 wave was mainly driven by the unvaccinated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00176-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we use a recently developed approach (the contribution matrix method) in combination with epidemiological data to estimate the contribution of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations to the current COVID-19 effective reproduction number &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; in Germany. We find that a substantial fraction of reproduction is caused by unvaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pdf of the paper is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00176-7.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of the German population was fully vaccinated at the time (about 65%), COVID-19 incidence started growing exponentially in October 2021 with about 41% of recorded new cases aged twelve or above being symptomatic breakthrough infections, presumably also contributing to the dynamics. So far, it remained elusive how significant this contribution was and whether targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may have stopped the amplification of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;methods&#34;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We develop and introduce a contribution matrix approach based on the next-generation matrix of a population-structured compartmental infectious disease model to derive contributions of respective inter- and intragroup infection pathways of unvaccinated and vaccinated subpopulations to the effective reproduction number and new infections, considering empirical data of vaccine efficacies against infection and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we show that about 61%–76% of all new infections were caused by unvaccinated individuals and only 24%–39% were caused by the vaccinated. Furthermore, 32%–51% of new infections were likely caused by unvaccinated infecting other unvaccinated. Decreasing the transmissibility of the unvaccinated by, e. g. targeted NPIs, causes a steeper decrease in the effective reproduction number R than decreasing the transmissibility of vaccinated individuals, potentially leading to temporary epidemic control. Reducing contacts between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals serves to decrease R in a similar manner as increasing vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minority of the German population—the unvaccinated—is assumed to have caused the majority of new infections in the fall of 2021 in Germany. Our results highlight the importance of combined measures, such as vaccination campaigns and targeted contact reductions to achieve temporary epidemic control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding disease outbreak locations from human mobility data</title>

      <title>New paper out: Finding disease outbreak locations from human mobility data</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/outbreak_detection/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/outbreak_detection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we investigated how much information on individual mobility patterns is required
to reconstruct the origin of an outbreak from spatially distributed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out: not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00306-6#citeas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the origin location of an infectious disease outbreak quickly is crucial in
mitigating its further dissemination. Current methods to identify outbreak locations
early on rely on interviewing affected individuals and correlating their movements,
which is a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process. Other methods such as
contact tracing, genomic sequencing or theoretical models of epidemic spread offer
help, but they are not applicable at the onset of an outbreak as they require highly
processed information or established transmission chains. Digital data sources such as
mobile phones offer new ways to find outbreak sources in an automated way. Here,
we propose a novel method to determine outbreak origins from geolocated
movement data of individuals affected by the outbreak. Our algorithm scans
movement trajectories for shared locations and identifies the outbreak origin as the
most dominant among them. We test the method using various empirical and
synthetic datasets, and demonstrate that it is able to single out the true outbreak
location with high accuracy, requiring only data of N = 4 individuals. The method can
be applied to scenarios with multiple outbreak locations, and is even able to estimate
the number of outbreak sources if unknown, while being robust to noise. Our
method is the first to offer a reliable, accurate out-of-the-box approach to identify
outbreak locations in the initial phase of an outbreak. It can be easily and quickly
applied in a crisis situation, improving on previous manual approaches. The method is
not only applicable in the context of disease outbreaks, but can be used to find
shared locations in movement data in other contexts as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Monitor: Contact patterns during the Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/contact_monitor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/contact_monitor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to mobility, we now show the average contacts in the population over time—with equally important insights into the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobility of people gives us an important overview of the pandemic, but it is actually the contacts between people that are instrumental in the infection dynamics: Transmissions occur when people meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/contact-index/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contact monitor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we make these contacts visible. The monitor shows the average number of contacts that a person in Germany had on a given day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can clearly see how strongly contacts have decreased in March 2020, and how they are still at a low level more than a year after the start of the pandemic. Also visible are the different phases of the pandemic and reactions to it with lockdowns, relaxations, holidays and vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contacts is calculated from GPS mobile phone data and provided to us as an anonymous, aggregated statistic - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/data-info/contacts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more on the methodology here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to analyze contact dynamics and investigate what conclusions can be drawn about infection dynamics. For example, in the study &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/31/e2026731118&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ruediger et al.&lt;/a&gt;, contacts were shown to be related to the reproductive number R.&lt;/p&gt;
