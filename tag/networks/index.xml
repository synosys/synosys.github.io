      <title>Clonal Interference in Heterogeneous Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our research group explores the intricate relationship between complex environmental structures and evolutionary processes, focusing on clonal interference in asexual populations. We aim to understand how organisms adapt in heterogeneous, network-like environments that closely resemble real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clonal interference (CI) occurs in asexual populations when multiple beneficial mutations arise and compete, unable to combine through recombination. While CI has been studied in well-mixed or simple spatial structures, its behavior in complex, heterogeneous environments remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;optional_cool.gif&#34; alt=&#34;cool gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Research Aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding CI in Highly Heterogeneous Environments: We investigate how diverse network topologies influence clonal interference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying Key Structural Components: We aim to pinpoint specific elements of network structures that significantly impact adaptive processes, understanding which features promote faster adaptation and which areas are likely sources of adaptive mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaping and Controlling Adaptive Evolution: By understanding how network structures influence evolution, we seek to develop strategies for potentially guiding adaptive processes in complex environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing Analytical Tools: We&amp;rsquo;re working to create and refine mathematical and computational tools that effectively model and predict evolutionary dynamics in intricate systems, bridging network theory, evolutionary biology, and complex systems science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights gained from our research have potential applications across a wide range of fields. In epidemiology, our understanding of how pathogens evolve in structured host populations could inform more effective disease management strategies. Conservation biologists might use our findings to guide habitat management practices, supporting species adaptation and resilience in fragmented environments. Our work could also lead to improved bioprocess designs by accounting for how environmental structure affects microbial evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these direct applications, the principles we uncover might have broader, more speculative implications. For instance, our approaches to mutation spread in biological networks could provide insights into how content goes viral on social media platforms with diverse user structures. The competition between genetic strains in our research might parallel how ideas, innovations and cultural practices propagate through social and professional networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to explore the intricate interplay between network complexity and evolutionary dynamics, we&amp;rsquo;re not merely advancing theoretical knowledge. We&amp;rsquo;re developing a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how adaptation occurs in complex systems. This research has the potential to open new avenues for managing and harnessing evolutionary processes in various fields, spanning from biology to the social sciences. By bridging the gap between network theory and evolutionary biology, we&amp;rsquo;re paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of how information – be it genetic, cultural, or technological – spreads and competes in our interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fungal Growth</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fungi interact in a mycorrhizal symbiosis with plants or are simple decomposers of organic matter.
In this project we investigate the growth of filamentous fungi by creating and investigating mathematical growth models.
We cooperate with experimental biologists from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aguilar-ecology.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;aguilar ecology lab&lt;/a&gt; who have a profound knowledge of the growth patterns of different fungal species (see Fig.1).
In a first &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ismecommun/article/2/1/2/7460968&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;network analysis of our collaborators&lt;/a&gt;, they identified that some network traits vary most in between species, as for example the meshedness (how different the network is from a fully-connected one without crossing edges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/2022Aguilar_network_paper_fig3adapted.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.1 - Different species of hyphal growing fungi and the reconstruction of the network they are forming.
  Figure is adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ismecommun/article/2/1/2/7460968&#34;&gt;Aguilar-Trigueros et al. (2022)&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We approach the problem from a modeling perspective, that means we build an agent based model, which is motivated from real fungi.
In our model each each agent represents the tip of a hyphen and the tip as well as the whole hyphen release an enzyme.
This enzyme diffuses though the environment and other tips/agents can sense the local concentration and gradient.
This is all the information the tip has about its environment, i.e. only local information is allowed.
New Tips/Agents are created either by an apical branching event, at which one tip splits in two, or by a lateral branching event, where from the lower half of a tip compartment muliple branches grow perpendicular to the local growth direction.
By varying some fundamental parameters of the model as the diffusion coefficient, the enzyme release rate or the number of lateral branches, different shapes can emerge as shown if Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/3_mycel_compilation.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;1200&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.2 -
  Depending on the parameters, the mycelium grows densely (A) or less densely (B, C) if for example the enzyme release rate is increased (B)  or the septation rule is adapted (C). The enzyme in the environment (orange and red background color) inhibit the growth of the mycelium, thus the mycelium is more responsive to its own form (compare A with B). In (A, B) the septation and lateral branching form always two septas and branches at each septation event. In (C) 6 septa and branches are formed during an septation event. While the quadrants 2-4 show the concentration on a variable linear scale (bottom colorbar), the 1st quadrant uses a fixed logarithmic scale (top colorbar) to enable a fair comparison between simulations.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our goals are now to reproduce key structural properties of real fungal species with a model as simple as possible, study the statistical properties of the different phases of the model and what task the fungi can perform at each phase best.
This is exciting, especially because we are able to switch between theory, modelling and experiments.
The big picture is of course the role of the fungi in the ecosystems in connection with their growth strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Import Risk</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/import_risk/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our globalized world is strongly connected, on the small scale by buses, trains, cars, and on the largest, global scale by the Worldwide Air transportation Network (WAN).
It is likely that our connectivity has not reached its peak yet, since for example the number of globally scheduled air passengers increased yearly by about 6% between 2004 and 2019.
The connectivity has huge consequences on the propagation of disease since with passengers comes everything that sticks to them, such as bacteria, viruses, earth clumps beneath their shoes etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project crosses the fields of network science, transportation, mobility and disease dynamics and its an offspring of the idea to not use the conventional distance (in meter, miles, feet &amp;hellip; pick your unit) as a metric but an &lt;strong&gt;effective distance&lt;/strong&gt; that is based on the mobility between regions.
When $P(B | A)$ is the probability to travel to B from A (which is computed from mobility fluxes) than the effective distance is $ d _{\text{eff}} (A | B) = d_0 - log (P(i| n_0)) $.
In the seminal paper by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brockmann and Helbing (2013)&lt;/a&gt; effective distance $d _{\text{eff}}$ was shown to linearly correlate with the arrival time of diseases as shown in Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/eff_dist_paper_adapted_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;Full&#34;/&gt;

  While the spread on the world map seems rather random, you see a nice circular wave spreading in the effective distance tree, illustrating the linear correlation to disease arrival times.
  Adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200&#34;&gt;Brockmann and Helbing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In our recent paper&lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser et al. (2024)&lt;/a&gt; we deepen the connection between the effective distance shortest path tree, spreading dynamics and mobility.
We present a way to estimate the passenger flow between any two airports (including those without direct connections) given that we only know the number and maximal capacity of planes (see illustrative example in Fig. 3).
At the end the method allows us to estimate the number of infected passenger leaving B when we know the number of infected that entered A.
Thus we know the risk of importation, why it is named &lt;b&gt;import risk method&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/relrisk.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 3 - Import Risk Example: 100 infected passengers board planes at airport X en route to destination airports elsewhere in the network, going through transit airports in the process. The relative import risk at a given destination is the fraction of the 100 individuals that entered at airport X and exited at that destination airport (red).
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic idea behind the import risk method is to let a random walker start at node B of the WAN and exit at each node with a probability derived from the effective distance shortest path tree.
The final fraction of times it leaves at node A is the import risk probability.
Now this method is parameter free and motivated by disease dynamics, but in the same time it provides a method to estimate mobility on a global scale.
The mobility estimation is a classic task in transportation science with well established models as the gravity model (proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2087063?casa_token=5goDmVg4aOkAAAAA%3A6Y9zup7UcSjT8DQ1izhRza_-N568nGLP_43ikQys0Vzoux-4qaYKp1u0Cruz2YwZ2hggPU2PIKW4oqbB6xnFtaJIgj-oX_zCbMwLneoPv8OzCdsFXA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1946 by Zipf&lt;/a&gt;).
A core aspect of our import risk paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser et al. (2024)&lt;/a&gt; is to compare our method to established mobility models.
We found that our approach outperforms the established models, and the crazy thing is, that our method is parameter free, while the gravity model always needs parameter estimation (one needs to know the real mobility flow beforehand).
This holds true if we check the prediction quality of for the 10 countries with the highest import probability, which especially important for disease propagation since these countries are the one that should increase their passenger control (shown in Fig. 4).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/ir_paper_fig_10cntrs.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 4 - Mobility model comparisons for top 10 import countries: The well established gravity model with exponential (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and power-law (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) distance decay, the parameter free radiation model (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;) and our import risk model (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;).
  Each dot is a country that is among the 10 countries with the highest import probability from another country (10 target countries x 183 source countries).
  A true or false positive (T.Pos. or F. Pos.) means that the country is or is not among the 10 countries with the highest reference import probability.
  A false negative (F. Neg.) means that it belongs according to reference it is among the top 10 but was not detected by the respective model.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We applied the measure during COVID-19 to estimate the countries that have been reached by Omicron without it beeing detected &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/reports/importrisk_omicron_update/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
And in a big cooperation with great collegues that have been put together by &lt;a href=&#34;https://manliodedomenico.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manlio De Domenico&lt;/a&gt; we have developed and validated a framework (&lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/6/pgad192/7191545?login=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser and d&amp;rsquo;Andrea et al. (2023)&lt;/a&gt;)that can estimate from sparse and noisy samples via phylogenetic analysis the time when the variant first occured in the origin country, how it spreads across the globe with our import risk model, and how the countries are affected by a disease dynamic model.
We were even able to smash everything into one number, which we call the &lt;strong&gt;pandemic delay&lt;/strong&gt;, that estimates how long it takes for a new emerging variant to make out 10% of all current cases in a respective country.
It revealed that only by combining mobility data with a phylogenetic estimate of the reproduction number, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly
assessed relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
