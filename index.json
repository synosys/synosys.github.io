Our work focuses on predicting how fungi interact with their environment by studying their morphology. Fungi share a deceptively simple body plan—a network of microscopic filaments. These networks underpin key ecological functions, from circulating carbon and nutrients in soils to causing major diseases in plants, including all major crops. Yet we still know surprisingly little about how such a simple body structure supports such a wide range of functions. By combining ecological experiments with image analysis and network theory—in close collaboration with SynoSys—we aim to move from descriptive observations of fungal form to predictive models of their development and function. In doing so, we are uncovering the secrets of one of nature’s most overlooked yet essential life forms.\n","date":1764720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1764716400,"objectID":"8d0972dd4ff800cd6d19f264079261ef","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/carlos/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/carlos/","section":"authors","summary":"I lead an ecology research group at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, with a visiting affiliation at SynoSys.

He studied physics and mathematics at the University of Göttingen, Germany where he received his PhD in theoretical physics.\nBefore becoming founding director of SynoSys he was professor at the Departments of Biology and Physics at Humboldt University of Berlin and led a research team at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany’s national public health institute. Between 2008 and 2013 he was professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University and faculty member of the Northwestern\u0026rsquo;s Institute on Complex Systems.\nDirk has worked on various topics, ranging from computational neuroscience and anomalous diffusion in biological and physical systems to infectious disease dynamics, human mobility, network theory and citizen science.\nHe pioneered the analysis of mass data obtained in natural experiments and understanding human behavior based on data collected by digital devices. During the COVID-19 pandemic he launched the German Data Donation Project, in which more than 500,000 donors provided data collected on their smart-watches and wearable devices on a daily basis for more than 2,5 years, the largest dataset of this kind in public hands worldwide.\nDirk believes in the value of anti-disciplinary science, the intentional breach of traditional scientific boundaries and is particularly interested in bridging the gap between biological and social sciences and the philosophy of complexity science. He coined the phrase \u0026ldquo;Get lost in Science!\u0026rdquo; to stress the importance of explorative research as opposed to hypothesis driven research, using a compass instead of a map for navigating the unknown.\nIn 2017 Dirk launched the Complexity Explorables, a collection of web-based interactive models of famous and less famous complex systems to illustrate the beauty of complex dynamical phenomena and teach young students about these systems.\nCurrently, Dirk is most interested in the design of citizen science projects, in which the general public can participate in scientific endeavours via digital tools and technologies. He is also interested in the emergence of cooperation, mutualism and fungi.\nDirk’s work has been covered extensively by the media and the press, e.g. the New York Times, the Washington Post, the BBC, various TV shows in the United States, Europe and Germany. During the pandemic he was a regular expert guest in numerous TV talk shows and the main German TV news shows.\nSelected Publications Citizen data sovereignty is key to wearables and wellness data reuse for the common good.\nStephen Gilbert, Katie Baca-Motes, Giorgio Quer, M Wiedermann, D Brockmann npj Digital Medicine (2024)7:27\r(2024).\rDOI\rView\rEvidence for positive long- and short-term effects of vaccinations against COVID-19 in wearable sensor metrics.\nM Wiedermann, A H Rose, B F Maier, Kolb, Jakob J., D Hinrichs, D Brockmann PNAS Nexus 2(7), pgad223 (2023)\r(2023).\rPDF\rDOI\rView\rEnhancing global preparedness during an ongoing pandemic from partial and noisy data.\nP Klamser, Valeria d’Andrea, Francesco Di Lauro, A Zachariae, Sebastiano Bontorin, Antonello Di Nardo, Matthew Hall, B F Maier, Luca Ferretti, D Brockmann, Manlio De Domenico PNAS Nexus 2(6), pgad192 (2023)\r(2023).\rDOI\rView\rGermany’s fourth COVID-19 wave was mainly driven by the unvaccinated.\nB F Maier, M Wiedermann, A Burdinski, P Klamser, M Jenny, C Betsch, D Brockmann Nature Commun.

The study “Decomposing Intolerance of Uncertainty: No Association With Affective Decision Making in a Community Sample” addresses a central question in psychology: How do people respond to uncertainty, and what drives these responses?\nIntolerance of uncertainty (IU) is considered a key factor across many psychological disorders, from anxiety to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Yet the mechanisms behind it remain unclear. To explore this, the authors identified three possible pathways: overweighting negative outcomes, distorting probabilities of rare events, and discomfort with missing information. They then mapped these mechanisms onto well-known patterns of human decision-making described by Cumulative Prospect Theory.\nTo test this link, the team designed an experiment with 100 participants. Instead of abstract lotteries with money, they used medical scenarios in which people had to choose between two hypothetical painkillers, each with possible side effects and varying chances of success. In one condition, all information was provided upfront. In the other, participants had to discover probabilities by sampling outcomes themselves. This allowed the researchers to compare decision-making under risk with decision-making under uncertainty.\nThe results confirmed that participants displayed common biases: they overweighed side effects compared to benefits (loss aversion), and they distorted small probabilities. Choices also differed depending on whether information was described or experienced, echoing the well-known description–experience gap. However, none of these behavioral patterns correlated with how strongly individuals reported disliking uncertainty on questionnaires.\nThis finding is important because it suggests that self-reported intolerance of uncertainty and observable decision-making behavior may capture different aspects of the phenomenon. The study points to the need for more precise definitions of IU and for experimental designs that can create stronger affective contexts, possibly with real consequences for behavior.\n👉 Read the full article here\n","date":1758585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1758585600,"objectID":"797a4277e7ea84c2cb429d5fffe7a5ec","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/news/computational_psychiatry/","publishdate":"2025-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/computational_psychiatry/","section":"news","summary":"A new study by Kamil Fuławka and colleagues shows that self-reported intolerance of uncertainty does not align with observable decision-making behavior, highlighting the need for more precise definitions and experimental approaches.","tags":["Uncertainty","Decision making","Intolerance of Uncertainty","Psychology","Computational Psychiatry"],"title":"How people say they feel about uncertainty does not match how they decide","type":"news"},{"authors":["Sami Nenno"],"categories":[],"content":"Sami Nenno, Postdoc in the Junior Research Group Computational Social Science at SynoSys, Center Synergy of Systems, has published a new article in Information, Communication \u0026amp; Society that addresses the question: Is public broadcasting an amplifier or a gatekeeper of misinformation?\nIn the study, he collected fact-checking articles and matched them with subtitles from more than 1,000 news and talk show episodes on German public broadcasting television.

However, the question arises as to how fact-checkers select the claims they check. This study examines the role of news factors for fact-checking. News factors and newsworthiness have been studied from multiple angles. There has been research on the selection criteria of journalists, but also on the factors that attract an audience to a specific piece of content. This study focuses on the journalistic perspective. However, as previous research suggests, the different perspectives are not always clearly separable. Especially, in the context of disinformation, the fact-checkers’ perspective is influenced by their target audience, and one can assume that the claims that are checked have been spread with news factors in mind, as well. Accordingly, this paper asks: What aim do news values serve for fact-checkers with respect to their target audience? (RQ1)\nBuilding on this, the question arises whether there is such a thing as a list of important news factors for fact-checking. Previous research finds that “classic” news factors such as timeliness, negativity, and prominence play a strong role. But specific factors such as virality, which are particularly typical of online environments, play a significant role, too. Therefore, the paper asks which news factors are more or less relevant for fact-checking. (RQ2) Finally, there is the question of how news factors can be measured or quantified. Metrics enable comparability. It can be assumed that this meets the transparency requirements of fact-checkers. The paper asks: How are news values measured for fact-checking? (RQ3)\nThe study examines two data sources. Semi-structured interviews with fact-checkers from Germany and Austria (n = 10) and an analysis of the claims to which fact-checking articles link (n = 9189). In particular, the study consists of a total of eight interviews with ten fact-checkers from six organizations in the period from August to September 2023. Five of these organizations fall under the newsroom model, and one falls under the NGO model. Additionally, I scraped all fact-checks between 2019 and 2023 of the following organizations: AFP, dpa, Correctiv, Faktenfuchs. This resulted in a total of 4959 fact-check articles. The checked claims were extracted based on the links in the articles. Annotators manually evaluated the method to separate links to claims from links to the evidence sources used by fact-checkers on an artificial week of 596 articles. The interviews provide an in-depth understanding of the role of the factors, while the analysis of the linked claims is used for triangulation, especially in relation to the importance of different platforms and social media engagement.\nThe news factors that inform fact-checkers’ efforts can be classified in two categories. First, “classic” news factors, such as timeliness or (geographical) proximity, inform the selection of claims to be fact-checked. Second, this study identified some news factors that are genuine to the fact-checking genre, such as the verifiability of the claim or the intention of the originator of the claim. In addition, classic factors such as reach play a special role. Fact-checkers are primarily aiming at an audience that is unsettled by misinformation but has not yet slipped into a conspiracy circle. There is also a strong concern that a premature fact-check can help a (false) claim gain more reach. Accordingly, the reach of a claim is primarily used to assess the public need to verify the claim. While many news factors are not easily measured, they are addressed in team meetings. For instance, this is the case with relevance, understood as personal involvement. Those characteristics of a claim that can be measured more easily, such as reach, clearly impact the decision whether it will be fact-checked or not. This means that news factors such as relevance play a role, yet not in a sense that can be justified through metrics. By contrast, news factors such as reach prove consequential and can be backed up with numbers. As expected, there is a lot of content from alternative media in the verified claims, however much of this content is only verified if it is also shared on social media and metrics such as likes or shares can be used to estimate its reach. Building on these findings, the study develops a schema that lists and takes into account the role, relevance, and different versions of news factors that are prevalent in the fact-checking process.","tags":["Political Misinformation","News Values"],"title":"What makes a claim checkworthy?

Although such research has investigated the topical and stylistic characteristics of misinformation, its findings are frequently not interpreted systematically in relation to properties that journalists rely on to capture the attention of audiences, that is, in relation to news values. We close the gap on comparative studies of news values in misinformation with a perspective that emphasizes non-WEIRD countries. Relying on a dataset of URLs that were shared on Facebook in twenty-four countries and reported by users as containing false news, we compile a large corpus of online news items and use an array of computational tools to analyze its content with respect to a set of five news values (conflict, negativity, proximity, individualization, and informativeness). We find salient differences for almost all news values and regarding the WEIRD/non-WEIRD and flagged/unflagged distinction. Moreover, the prevalence of individual news values differs strongly for individual countries. However, while almost all differences are significant, the effects we encounter are mostly small.","tags":["Political Misinformation","News Values","WEIRD Countries","Non-WEIRD Countries","Social Media Misinformation","Facebook Dataset","Computational Analysis","Comparative Studies"],"title":"All The (Fake) News That’s Fit to Share?

By contrast, we know little about the extent of misinformation in mainstream media. While many argue that it acts as a gatekeeper, others think it could amplify the reach of misinformation. This study investigates misinformation on public broadcasting television. By semi-automatically matching fact-checked claims with statements from the subtitles of four German news and six talk shows, the study examines the dynamics of these claims. It finds 77 matches in 67 episodes, amounting to 4.85% of the 1382 episodes during the sampling period between June 2023 and June 2024. The rate is higher for talk shows (11.62%) than for news shows (2.28%). The claims cover a range of topics and often aim to destabilize trust in public institutions or discredit the political course of opposing parties. In most cases, they are made by politicians from populist or (far) right parties. In about half of cases, the claim is contradicted by the journalist or talk show guest, but often it is left uncommented, even if the claim was fact-checked before or the speaker was already known to have made the claim. The match rate for fact-checking organizations increases with their affinity for checking claims made by public figures. At the same time, the study finds no evidence that misinformation from anonymous online sources has infiltrated public broadcasting. This speaks against an amplification effect and points to a separation between online misinformation and that found on public television.","tags":["Political Misinformation","News Values","Fact Checking","Talk Shows","Misinformation","Computational Analysis"],"title":"Separate worlds of misinformation.

While machine learning excels at predicting user behavior, statistical modeling—a cornerstone of empirical research—is critical for interpretable analysis. It helps uncover relationships between user behavior and various factors (e.g., how demographics influence engagement patterns) and enables causal inference in experiments (e.g., measuring the impact of different feed-ranking algorithms on user experience). These methods are widely used in UX research, product analytics, and A/B testing.\nThis course provides a hands-on introduction to statistical modeling in R, focusing on methods most useful for analyzing behavioral data. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover key concepts and progress to model selection based on outcome type. Topics include logistic regression for binary outcomes (e.g., like/dislike reactions), ordinal regression for rating scales, beta regression for continuous feedback (e.g., sliders), and hierarchical models for nested data (e.g., multiple ratings from the same users). In the end, you\u0026rsquo;ll not only know which model to use but also how to effectively visualize and communicate your findings through clear, interpretable result presentations.\nNo prior statistical modeling experience is required.

We will also explore how to collect such data from social media and how to conduct online field experiments. We will then have the tools to move on to applied research questions, covering topics such as political polarization, misinformation, public health and human mobility. We will learn what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from these descriptions. Finally, we will go beyond description and learn about causality, simulation models of social systems that allow mechanistic understanding.\nThe last part of the course will focus on NLP again, this time with a focus on deep learning methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs). We will use transformer models to identify complex patterns in the communication of German parties on social media.\nIn summary, this course will provide a toolbox for describing different types of social systems with a focus on textual data, as well as a family of modelling approaches that can go beyond individual-level statistics to describe collective processes.\nSchedule: Week 1 What is Computational Social Science?\nWeek 2 Data, types, sources and preparation in R/Python\nWeek 3 Collecting text data\nWeek 4 Identifying sentiment and clusters\nWeek 5 Time series analysis\nWeek 6 Regressions and statistical modeling\nWeek 7 Network science 1\nWeek 8 Network science 2\nWeek 9 Causal inference in observational data\nBreak June 8 - 15\nWeek 10 Agent-based-models\nWeek 11 Topic Modeling with Transformers 1\nWeek 12 Topic Modeling with Transformers 2\nWeek 13 LLMs\nWeek 14 Final session, feedback, Q\u0026amp;A, Discussion\nBibliography: Llaudet, E., \u0026amp; Imai, K.

This, he argued, is precisely what scientists must do in their research: approach the unknown with a sense of wonder, question assumptions, and stay open to unexpected discoveries. Just as magic challenges our understanding of reality, scientific breakthroughs emerge when we push beyond the boundaries of what we think we know. Doing science with a compass rather than a map.

Of course, fact-checking, like any other journalistic genre, is not free of errors and distortions. However, it is often overlooked that disinformation is frequently associated with right-wing and populist attitudes (Lasser et al. 2022, Törnberg and Chueri 2025). If fact-checks tend to scrutinise right-wing actors, this does not necessarily reveal a bias, but could also reflect an actual asymmetry (Mosleh et al. 2024). For example, a recent study shows that helpful Notes are also more likely to be found in posts from the Republicans (Renault et al. 2025).\nThis blog post presents the results of a data analysis of German-language Notes that were rated as helpful or unhelpful at least 20 times and published between January 2024 and January 2025 inclusive. As Notes will also be launched on Facebook and Instagram in the future (initially only in the US), it is worth asking whether there is a focus on parties from a particular ideological spectrum.\nHow do Community Notes work on X? Notes are found as comments on posts and are intended to point out their shortcomings. The Notes for this data analysis show posts as incorrect or unverified (Fig. 1). Notes are written by previously registered users. To register, the account must be older than six months and a verified phone number is required. Because anyone can participate, Notes are often described as the wisdom of the crowd and contrasted with fact-checks as an unbiased alternative. However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that the users who write Notes are not free of political views. Their assessments and comments may therefore be influenced by their own interests or ideological biases (Allen et al. 2022).\nFigure 1 Post with a community note that was rated as helpful and therefore published.\nPrecisely because a single registration is enough to write Notes for all posts on X, this is not yet a sign of quality for their correctness. For this reason, registered users can not only write their own Notes, but also rate the Notes of others as helpful or not. To arrive at a final rating, X uses a so-called bridging algorithm. This algorithm takes into account the position of registered users on the political spectrum and requires contributors with different viewpoints to rate the note as helpful (Wojcik et al. 2022). This process is often successful in reflecting the political spectrum, but it also ensures that significantly fewer Notes are published than are actually written.\nWhich accounts of German parties and politicians receive Community Notes? Figure 2 Number of posts with Community Notes.\nIn the following, I present the results of the data analysis. In total, I analysed almost 9000 Notes, of which almost 1700 were considered helpful and therefore published. Figure 2a shows the accounts with the most Notes. Of all accounts on X, Markus Söder, the leader of the CSU and Chief Minister of Bavaria, received the most Notes. However, this changes when it comes to helpful Notes (Fig. 2b). Here, with the exception of Julian Reichelt, former editor-in-chief of Bild and founder of Nius, rather unknown accounts are among the top-ranked accounts. Political accounts, namely those of the CSU and Markus Söder, are only found from 8th place onwards. With this in mind, and also looking at Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, we can see that the accounts with the most Notes and those with the most helpful Notes are in some cases very different.\nWhich parties receive the most Community Notes? Figure 3 Number of posts with Community Notes.\nFigure 3 shows the Notes of German politicians by party. Party scores are often strongly influenced by individual politicians. As shown in Figure 2, for the CSU it is mainly the official party account and that of Markus Söder. For the SPD it is mainly Ralf Stegner, member of the Bundestag, and Arno Gottschalk, financial policy spokesman for the Bremen parliamentary group. A rough analysis of the content shows that Stegner\u0026rsquo;s posts mainly relate to the Russian war in Ukraine.\nAs before, the ranking of most Notes differs if you only look at the helpful ones.

News Values in Perceived Misinformation Across Twenty-Four Countries. Co-written with Cornelius Puschmann, the study has been published in The International Journal of Press/Politics and investigates the relationship between journalistic news values and perceived misinformation in diverse national contexts.\nThe research addresses a notable gap in the understanding of how misinformation is shaped and perceived globally. While much of the previous scholarship has focused on misinformation within WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries, this study expands the scope by including both WEIRD and non-WEIRD regions. Using a dataset of over 770,000 Facebook-shared URLs flagged as misinformation by users, the study analyzes the prevalence of five key news values: conflict, negativity, proximity, individualization, and informativeness. Through computational analysis, the authors explore how these news values appear in flagged and unflagged content and assess their variation across 24 countries.\nThe research reveals that flagged content, often perceived as misinformation, tends to emphasize conflict and negativity more strongly than unflagged content. Other news values, such as proximity and individualization, also appear more prominently in flagged items, though with varying intensity. Significant differences in the prevalence of news values were observed between WEIRD and non-WEIRD countries. For instance, proximity and negativity were found to be more pronounced in WEIRD countries, whereas individualization was more prevalent in non-WEIRD contexts. The study also highlights unique patterns in countries such as the United States and Brazil, where conflict and negativity were particularly dominant in flagged content.\nThe findings challenge existing frameworks of news values, which were primarily developed within Western contexts, by showing that these models may not fully account for the diversity of global media landscapes. This emphasizes the need for more inclusive theoretical models that better reflect regional and cultural differences.\nThis study contributes to the growing field of misinformation research by providing a global perspective on how news values intersect with perceived misinformation. It highlights the influence of journalistic styles and national media systems on the characteristics of flagged content, offering valuable insights for academics, journalists, and policymakers seeking to address the challenges posed by misinformation.\nThis publication was part of Sami Nenno\u0026rsquo;s PhD project and was written during his time at the University of Bremen and at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

It reduces the complex spreading patterns of a pandemic to a wave-like propagation from the outbreak country, establishing a linear relationship to the arrival time of the unmitigated spread of a disease. However, in the early stages of an outbreak, what concerns decision-makers in countries is understanding the relative risk of active cases arriving in their country—essentially, the likelihood that an active case boarding an airplane at the outbreak location will reach them. While there are data-fitted models available to estimate these risks, accurate mechanistic, parameter-free models are still lacking. Therefore, we introduce the ‘import risk’ model in this study, which defines import probabilities using the effective-distance framework. The model assumes that airline passengers are distributed along the shortest path tree that starts at the outbreak’s origin. In combination with a random walk, we account for all possible paths, thus inferring predominant connecting flights. Our model outperforms other mobility models, such as the radiation and gravity model with varying distance types, and it improves further if additional geographic information is included. The import risk model’s precision increases for countries with stronger connections within the WAN, and it reveals a geographic distance dependence that implies a pull- rather than a push-dynamic in the distribution process.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","mobility"],"title":"Inferring country-specific import risk of diseases from the world air transportation network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"We’re not hiring at the moment, but we’re always looking for talented and motivated individuals.

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) has been recognized as one of the most frequent manifestations of PCC and is a diagnostic criterion of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Yet, its underlying pathomechanisms remain poorly elucidated. \n In this review, we describe current evidence indicating that key pathophysiological features of PCC and ME/CFS are involved in physical activity-induced PEM. \n Upon physical activity, affected patients exhibit a reduced systemic oxygen extraction and oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Accumulating evidence suggests that these are mediated by dysfunctions in mitochondrial capacities and microcirculation that are maintained by latent immune activation, conjointly impairing peripheral bioenergetics. Aggravating deficits in tissue perfusion and oxygen utilization during activities cause exertional intolerance that are frequently accompanied by tachycardia, dyspnea, early cessation of activity and elicit downstream metabolic effects. The accumulation of molecules such as lactate, reactive oxygen species or prostaglandins might trigger local and systemic immune activation. Subsequent intensification of bioenergetic inflexibilities, muscular ionic disturbances and modulation of central nervous system functions can lead to an exacerbation of existing pathologies and symptoms.

We aim to understand how organisms adapt in heterogeneous, network-like environments that closely resemble real-world scenarios.\nClonal interference (CI) occurs in asexual populations when multiple beneficial mutations arise and compete, unable to combine through recombination. While CI has been studied in well-mixed or simple spatial structures, its behavior in complex, heterogeneous environments remains largely unexplored.\nKey Research Aims:\nUnderstanding CI in Highly Heterogeneous Environments: We investigate how diverse network topologies influence clonal interference. Identifying Key Structural Components: We aim to pinpoint specific elements of network structures that significantly impact adaptive processes, understanding which features promote faster adaptation and which areas are likely sources of adaptive mutations. Shaping and Controlling Adaptive Evolution: By understanding how network structures influence evolution, we seek to develop strategies for potentially guiding adaptive processes in complex environments. Developing Analytical Tools: We\u0026rsquo;re working to create and refine mathematical and computational tools that effectively model and predict evolutionary dynamics in intricate systems, bridging network theory, evolutionary biology, and complex systems science. The insights gained from our research have potential applications across a wide range of fields. In epidemiology, our understanding of how pathogens evolve in structured host populations could form more effective disease management strategies. Conservation biologists might use our findings to guide habitat management practices, supporting species adaptation and resilience in fragmented environments. Our work could also lead to improved bioprocess designs by accounting for how environmental structure affects microbial evolution.\nBeyond these direct applications, the principles we uncover might have broader, more speculative implications. For instance, our approaches to mutation spread in biological networks could provide insights into how content goes viral on social media platforms with diverse user structures.

The recent COVID-19 outbreak and its rapid global spread highlight the urgent need for tools that can limit the spreading of infectious diseases at the earliest stage possible to prevent global pandemics. Previous research has suggested the potential to detect COVID-19 infections through the observation of physiological alterations occurring after the onset of the disease, including elevated resting heart rates, extended sleep durations, and decreased physical activity. Wearable sensors, equipped to monitor these changes, in conjunction with machine learning algorithms trained on data from these sensors, could identify these variations, thus providing a method to quickly classify individuals as infected. Utilizing wearable sensor data from the Corona Data Donation Project, which encompasses resting heart rate, step count, and sleep duration time series from over 120,000 voluntary participants, a Logistic Regression model was developed for the classification of submitted COVID-19 test results. This model achieved classification success, as evidenced by a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.58, precision of 0.26, and recall of 0.54. The implementation of the catch22 feature set for feature extraction from the submitted wearable sensor data enhanced the interpretability of the classification algorithm. It also enables a more detailed analysis of the specific physiological changes used to differentiate individuals testing positive or negative for COVID-19. This study emphasizes the capability of predicting COVID-19 across large cohorts and underscores the value of employing infectious disease prediction models based on wearable sensor data as an additional public health tool. The LR model presented in Fig. 1 demonstrated prediction capabilities for COVID-19 test results surpassing random chance, thereby facilitating the early detection of this infectious disease. Additionally, the incorporation of catch22 features into the feature engineering process enhanced the interpretability of the classification decisions made by the model. The predictive LR model shown in Fig. 1 demonstrated satisfactory performance, notable given the voluntary nature of data submission, the impossibility of verifying correct and constant wear of devices, reliance on daily averages, absence of precise test and symptom onset dates, and the utilization of multiple devices across a broad cohort. The present study introduced a predictive model that has been trained on a considerable cohort size, addressing concerns from existing research about models only trained on significantly smaller cohorts. Additionally, this study tackled the issue of geographic underrepresentation by developing a predictive model for COVID-19 classification with data donated outside the United States, addressing other concerns in existing literature. Additionally confirmatory models have been developed which showed performances consistent with existing literature, validating its efficacy in confirming COVID-19 infections within this study’s framework. Enhancements in confirmatory capability were noted with the increasing days included after a COVID-19 test submission, indicating that a longer observational period bolsters the model’s confirmatory power. Employing interpretable catch22 feature engineering provided clarity in the classification process and verified that the detected signals coincide with physiological responses to COVID-19 infection, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. This consistency in signal detection across the models and their alignment with other research accentuates the catch22 features’ ability to accurately capture vital data signals from wearable sensor data. Conclusively, this study proposes a combined approach of catch22 feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms as an effective strategy in combating the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Highlighting that this methodology could be particulary valuable in the initial stages of a pandemic, where traditional methods might be unavailable. Thus, it offers an essential addition to public health resources. This study stresses the potential of utilizing wearable sensor data, combined with automated feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms, for the detection and confirmation of diseases like COVID-19. With additional advancements machine learning approaches to detect illnesses like COVID-19 using wearable sensor data could significantly improve the readiness and response to future public health crise\nFig. 2 - Permutation Feature Importance for the test dataset for the Confirmatory LR: Focusing on features that led to a mean increase in model performance (increase in Geometric Mean (GM)).

In this project, we investigate the growth of filamentous fungi by creating and investigating mathematical growth models. We cooperate with experimental biologists from the aguilar ecology lab who have a profound knowledge of the growth patterns of different fungal species (see Fig.1). In a first network analysis of our collaborators, they identified that some network traits vary most in between species, as for example the meshedness (how different the network is from a fully-connected one without crossing edges).\nFig.1 - Different species of hyphal growing fungi and the reconstruction of the network they are forming.\rFigure is adapted from Aguilar-Trigueros et al. (2022).\rWe address the problem from a modeling perspective, that means we build an agent-based model, which is motivated from real fungi. In our model each agent represents the tip of a hyphen and the tip as well as the whole hyphen release an enzyme. This enzyme diffuses though the environment and other tips/agents can sense the local concentration and gradient. This is all the information the tip has about its environment, i.e. only local information is allowed. New Tips/Agents are created either by an apical branching event, at which one tip splits in two, or by a lateral branching event, where from the lower half of a tip compartment multiple branches grow perpendicular to the local growth direction. By varying some fundamental parameters of the model as the diffusion coefficient, the enzyme release rate or the number of lateral branches, different shapes can emerge as shown if Fig. 2.\nFig.2 -\rDepending on the parameters, the mycelium grows densely (A) or less densely (B, C) if for example the enzyme release rate is increased (B) or the septation rule is adapted (C). The enzyme in the environment (orange and red background color) inhibits the growth of the mycelium, thus the mycelium is more responsive to its own form (compare A with B). In (A, B) the septation and lateral branching form always two septa and branches at each septation event. In (C) 6 septa and branches are formed during a septation event. While the quadrants 2-4 show the concentration on a variable linear scale (bottom color bar), the 1st quadrant uses a fixed logarithmic scale (top color bar) to enable a fair comparison between simulations.\rOur goals are now to reproduce key structural properties of real fungal species with a model as simple as possible, study the statistical properties of the different phases of the model and what task the fungi can perform beast at every phase. This is exciting, especially because we are able to switch between theory, modelling and experiments. The big picture is of course the role of the fungi in the ecosystems in connection with their growth strategies.\n","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"60e949c48bacc48de8537f88d948d500","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/","publishdate":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fungal_growth/","section":"project","summary":"Fungi interact in a mycorrhizal symbiosis with plants or are simple decomposers of organic matter.

It is likely that our connectivity has not reached its peak yet, since for example the number of globally scheduled air passengers increased yearly by about 6% between 2004 and 2019. The connectivity has immense consequences on the propagation of disease since alongside passengers everything that sticks to them, such as bacteria, viruses, earth clumps beneath their shoes etc. comes with.\nThis project crosses the fields of network science, transportation, mobility and disease dynamics and it\u0026rsquo;s an offspring of the idea to not use the conventional distance (in meter, miles, feet \u0026hellip; pick your unit) as a metric but an effective distance that is based on the mobility between regions. When - $P(B | A)$ is the probability to travel to B from A (which is computed from mobility fluxes) than the effective distance is $ d _{\\text{eff}} (A | B) = d_0 - log (P(i| n_0)) $ -. In the seminal paper by Brockmann and Helbing (2013) _effective distance $d _{\\text{eff}}$ - was shown to linearly correlate with the arrival time of diseases as shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 2 - The shortest path tree based on the effective distance with the airport of Hong Kong as origin (A) and how a pandemic spreads around the globe (B).\rWhile the spread on the world map seems rather random, you see a nice circular wave spreading in the effective distance tree, illustrating the linear correlation to disease arrival times.\rAdapted from Brockmann and Helbing.\rIn our recent paper Klamser et al. (2024), we deepen the connection between the effective distance shortest path tree, spreading dynamics and mobility. We present a way to estimate the passenger flow between any two airports (including those without direct connections) given that we only know the number and maximal capacity of planes (see illustrative example in Fig. 3). In the end, the method allows us to estimate the number of infected passenger leaving B when we know the number of infected that entered A. Thus, we know the risk of importation and why it is named import risk method.\nFig. 3 - Import Risk Example: 100 infected passengers board planes at airport X en route to destination airports elsewhere in the network, going through transit airports in the process. The relative import risk at a given destination is the fraction of the 100 individuals that entered at airport X and exited at that destination airport (red).\rThe mechanistic idea behind the import risk method is to let a random walker start at node B of the WAN and exit at each node with a probability derived from the effective distance shortest path tree. The final fraction of times it leaves at node A is the import risk probability. Now, this method is parameter free and motivated by disease dynamics, but at the same time it provides a method to estimate mobility on a global scale. The mobility estimation is a classic task in transportation science with well-established models as the gravity model (proposed in 1946 by Zipf). A core aspect of our import risk paper Klamser et al. (2024) is to compare our method to established mobility models. We found that our approach outperforms the established models, and the crazy thing is, that our method is parameter free, while the gravity model always needs parameter estimation (one needs to know the real mobility flow beforehand). This holds true if we check the prediction quality for the 10 countries with the highest import probability, which is especially important for disease propagation since these countries are the one that should increase their passenger control (shown in Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 - Mobility model comparisons for top 10 import countries: The well-established gravity model with exponential (A) and power-law (B) distance decay, the parameter free radiation model (C) and our import risk model (D).\rEach dot is a country that is among the 10 countries with the highest import probability from another country (10 target countries x 183 source countries).\rA true or false positive (T.Pos. or F. Pos.) means that the country is or is not among the 10 countries with the highest reference import probability.\rA false negative (F. Neg.) means that it belongs according to reference it is among the top 10 but was not detected by the respective model.\rFigure adapted from Klamser et al. (2024).\rWe applied the measure during COVID-19 to estimate the countries that have been reached by Omicron without it being detected here. And in a big cooperation with great colleagues that have been put together by Manlio De Domenico, we have developed and validated a framework (Klamser and d\u0026rsquo;Andrea et al. (2023))that can estimate from sparse and noisy samples via phylogenetic analysis the time when the variant first occurred in the country of origin, how it spreads across the globe with our import risk model, and how the countries are affected by a disease dynamic model. We were even able to smash everything into one number, which we call the pandemic delay, that estimates how long it takes for a new emerging variant to make out 10% of all current cases in a respective country. It revealed that only by combining mobility data with a phylogenetic estimate of the reproduction number, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly assessed relative to each other.\n","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"90aa0bf3a754f9c0decdc0131be0ae23","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/project/import_risk/","publishdate":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/import_risk/","section":"project","summary":"Our globalized world is strongly connected, on the small scale by buses, trains, cars, and on the largest, global scale by the Worldwide Air transportation Network (WAN).

In the present study, the marketplace in question is the online digital environment, the market cries are news headlines, the vendors are content producers (journalists and editors), the consumers are readers, and the currency is their limited attention. In the digital age, large amounts of content can be produced quickly and inexpensively, and transmitted and stored with high fidelity (Acerbi, 2019). From an economic perspective this represents a contestable market (Munger, 2020): because up-front costs are low, entry to this market is potentially open to many more content producers. An abundance of content means increased competition for limited attention, fiercer algorithmic, social and personal selection, and a higher turnover of content (Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2019), a situation aptly described as an attention economy (Simon et al., 1971). With an overabundance of content, only a small fraction of content eventually reaches the user, even less is ultimately consumed and engaged with (see González-Bailón et al., 2023 for the funnel of engagement).

Therefore, for fish populations, in temperate regions with seasonal and daily environmental oscillations, characteristic rhythms of social relationships should be pronounced. To date, most research concerning fish social networks and biorhythms has occurred in artificial laboratory environments or over confined temporal scales of days to weeks. By contrast, little is known about the social networks of wild, freely roaming fish, including how seasonal and diurnal rhythms modulate social networks over the course of a full year. The advent of high-resolution acoustic telemetry enables us to quantify detailed social interactions in the wild over time-scales sufficient to examine seasonal rhythms at whole-ecosystems scales. Our objective was to explore the rhythms of social interactions in a social fish population at various time-scales over one full year in the wild by examining high-resolution snapshots of dynamic social network. To that end, we tracked the behaviour of 36 adult common carp, Cyprinus carpio, in a 25 ha lake and constructed temporal social networks among individuals across various time-scales, where social interactions were defined by proximity. We compared the network structure to a temporally shuffled null model to examine the importance of social attraction, and checked for persistent characteristic groups (“friendships”) over time. The clustering within the carp social network tended to be more pronounced during daytime than nighttime throughout the year. Social attraction, particularly during daytime, was a key driver for interactions. Shoaling behavior substantially increased during daytime in the wintertime, whereas in summer carp interacted less frequently, but the interaction duration increased. Characteristic groups were more common in the summer months and during nighttime, where the social memory of carp lasted up to two weeks. We conclude that social relationships of carp change diurnally and seasonally. These patterns were likely driven by predator avoidance, seasonal shifts in lake temperature, visibility, forage availability and the presence of anoxic zones. The techniques we employed can be applied generally to high-resolution biotelemetry data to reveal social structures across other fish species at ecologically realistic scales.","tags":["fish","collective behavior","networks","temporal networks","contact patterns","animal behavior"],"title":"Rhythm of relationships in a social fish over the course of a full year in the wild","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Annika Rose","Benjamin F.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term changes in personal health and health-related wellbeing after a SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a subject of debate. Such effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration around a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data were collected over a period of 2 years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with around 190,000 monthly active participants. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals, on average, experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude.

The potential threat posed by its rapid spread in Germany was, at the time, difficult to predict. We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered infectious-disease model that included information about variant-specific and waning VEs based on empirical data available at the time. Compared to other approaches, our method aimed for minimal structural and computational complexity and therefore enabled us to respond to changes in the situation in a more agile manner while still being able to analyze the potential influence of (non-)pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the emerging crisis. Thus, the model allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs), the efficacy of contact reduction strategies, and the success of the booster vaccine rollout campaign. We expected a large cumulative number of infections with the VOC Omicron in Germany with ICU occupancy likely remaining below capacity, nevertheless, even without additional NPIs. The projected figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid-February and mid-March. Most surprisingly, our model showed that early, strict, and short contact reductions could have led to a strong ‘rebound’ effect with high incidences after the end of the respective NPIs, despite a potentially successful booster campaign. The results presented here informed legislation in Germany. The methodology developed in this study might be used to estimate the impact of future waves of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Modeling the impact of the Omicron infection wave in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin F.

Yet, reliable estimates regarding population-wide susceptibility were of considerable interest: Since both previous infection and vaccination reduce the risk of severe disease, a low share of immunologically naïve individuals lowers the probability of further severe outbreaks, given that emerging variants do not escape the acquired susceptibility reduction. Here, we estimate the share of immunologically naïve individuals by age group for each of the sixteen German federal states by integrating an infectious-disease model based on weekly incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the national surveillance system and vaccine uptake, as well as assumptions regarding under-ascertainment. We estimate a median share of 5.6% of individuals in the German population have neither been in contact with vaccine nor any variant up to 31 May 2022 (quartile range [2.5%–8.5%]). For the adult population at higher risk of severe disease, this figure is reduced to 3.8% [1.6%–5.9%] for ages 18–59 and 2.1% [1.0%–3.4%] for ages 60 and above. However, estimates vary between German states mostly due to heterogeneous vaccine uptake. Excluding Omicron infections from the analysis, 16.3% [14.1%–17.9%] of the population in Germany, across all ages, are estimated to be immunologically naïve, highlighting the large impact the first two Omicron waves had until the beginning of summer in 2022. The method developed here might be useful for similar estimations in other countries or future outbreaks of other infectious diseases.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Estimating the share of SARS-CoV-2- immunologically naïve individuals in Germany up to June 2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

When poorly deployed, these resources are misspent and have an inefficient impact. In a dynamic environment where sources of outbreaks are ever-changing, how to optimally deploy these resources is difficult to identify and can moreover change over time. In addressment, we outline and test network-driven framework that accounts for underlying patient mobility, and outbreak dynamics in hospitals to predict the temporal and spatial arrival of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) outbreaks.\nMethods We reconstructed CPE-outbreaks using a novel formulation based on transmission-dynamics, contact-interactions, and microbiology data. For each outbreak, we then examine their spatial evolution and, using background hospital population movement (entire patient population from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust between 2018-08-17 and 2022-02-03), we predict the arrival times of new CPE cases across wards.\nFindings The background mobility-network contained ward-transitions from 181,512 patients (178 wards). Based on the construction, the network comprises a single giant component and acts as a medium for disease transmission. For the results of a fitted regression predicting outbreak arrival, we included locational attributes, in addition to network distances. Overall, we found that effective distance (a graphbased path measure shown previously epidemiologically predictive) contained unique predictive power compared to edge weight. However, the effective distance could be complemented by information regarding patient demographics (Age and Sex) of patient transfers; their predictive power is suggestive of specific sub-population mobility as more important drivers of CPE.\nConclusion We investigated a network-driven framework showing the potential to anticipate arrival-times of hospital CPE outbreaks. In including additional information, we also showed how specific hospital population movements were key drivers of CPE. In furthering our results, we next plan to investigate additional diseases, validate our findings beyond our current dataset, and explore further locational attributes.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Reconstructing and predicting the spatial evolution of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D J.

The results indicate that private compliance was stronger among older individuals and females; among those who worried more about the pandemic situation and assumed that infection was more severe; among those who trusted the government more; and among those who did not perceive public health measures as exaggerated. Private compliance was also associated with personality traits; in particular, individuals who followed regulations and recommendations were likely to be more introverted, conscientious, open, and agreeable. Compliance at work related to both private compliance and colleagues' behaviors. Individuals whose private compliance was high also complied at work. However, when private compliance was low, compliance at work aligned with colleagues’ behaviors; that is, compliance at work was high when colleagues complied and low when they did not. The observed effects were stable over time. In summary, they suggest that compliance with regulations and recommendations depends on individual risk perception, trust in government, perception of required or recommended measures, and social norms.

The potential threat posed by the rapid spread of this variant in Germany remained, at the time, elusive. We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) infectious disease model. The model was calibrated on the observed fixation dynamics of the Omicron variant in December 2021, and allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs) and the efficacy of contact reduction strategies. A maximum median incidence of approximately 300 000 (50% PI in 1000: [181,454], 95% PI in 1000: [55,804]) reported cases per day was expected with the median peak occurring in the mid of February 2022, reaching a cumulative Omicron case count of 16.5 million (50% PI in mio: [11.4, 21.3], 95% PI in mio: [4.1, 27.9]) until Apr 1, 2022. These figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid February (peak: 191k daily new cases) and mid March (peak: 230k daily new cases), cumulatively infecting 14.8 million individuals during the study period. The model peak incidence was observed to be highly sensitive to variations in the assumed generation time and decreased with shorter generation time. Low contact reductions were expected to lead to containment. Early, strict, and short contact reductions could have led to a strong “rebound” effect with high incidences after the end of the respective non-pharmaceutical interventions. Higher vaccine uptake would have led to a lower outbreak size. To ensure that ICU occupancy remained below maximum capacity, a relative risk of requiring ICU care of 10%–20% was necessary (after infection with Omicron vs. infection with Delta). We expected a large cumulative number of infections with the VOC Omicron in Germany with ICU occupancy likely remaining below capacity nevertheless, even without additional non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our estimates were in line with the retrospectively observed waves. The results presented here informed legislation in Germany. The methodology developed in this study might be used to estimate the impact of future waves of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.\n","date":1657411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657411200,"objectID":"4a3a226b35a8b2716ddd1b416ec52514","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/old_news/omicron/","publishdate":"2022-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/old_news/omicron/","section":"old_news","summary":"Abstract In November 2021, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 “variant of concern” (VOC) B.1.1.529 (“Omicron”) was reported in Germany, alongside global reports of reduced vaccine efficacy against infections with this variant.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"New Preprint Out: Modeling the impact of the Omicron infection wave in Germany","type":"old_news"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654819200,"objectID":"9a89150c854d585ce7429d2b6665c8aa","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/old_news/dirk_re_publica/","publishdate":"2022-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/old_news/dirk_re_publica/","section":"old_news","summary":"Dirk speaks at re:publica 22 about complexity, anti-disciplinary sciences, aphids that grow wings when infected with a virus, swarms, seeing the forest for the trees, synchronization and networks (the talk is in German)","tags":["complexity","complex systems","anti-disciplinary science","video clip"],"title":"Dirk  @ re:publica 22","type":"old_news"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1650585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650585600,"objectID":"1b67af83f67eba6781a5c2c1cfde3fb7","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/old_news/lets_talk_change/","publishdate":"2022-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/old_news/lets_talk_change/","section":"old_news","summary":"Prof. Dr. Dirk Brockmann: Was können wir aus der Komplexitätsforschung für soziale Kipppunkte lernen?

Yet the full extent to which the population has been in contact with either virus or vaccine remains elusive, particularly on a regional level, because (a) infection counts suffer from under-reporting, and (b) the overlap between the vaccinated and recovered subpopulations is unknown. Since previous infection, vaccination, or especially a combination of both reduce the risk of severe disease, a high share of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 immunity lowers the probability of severe outbreaks that could potentially overburden the public health system once again, given that emerging variants do not escape this reduction in susceptibility. Here, we estimate the share of immunologically naïve individuals by age group for each of the 16 German federal states by integrating an infectious disease model based on weekly incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the national surveillance system and vaccine uptake, as well as assumptions regarding under-ascertainment. We estimate a median share of 7.0% of individuals in the German population have neither been in contact with vaccine nor any variant as of March 31, 2022 (quartile range [3.6%– 9.8%]). For the adult population at higher risk of severe disease, this figure is reduced to 3.5% [1.3%–5.5%] for ages 18–59 and 4.3% [2.7%–5.8%] for ages 60 and above. However, estimates vary between German states mostly due to heterogeneous vaccine uptake. Excluding Omicron infections from the analysis, 16.1% [14.0%–17.8%] of the population in Germany, across all ages, are estimated to be immunologically naïve, highlighting the large impact the Omicron wave had until the beginning of spring in 2022.","tags":["COVID-19","Datenspende","data donation project","Corona","pandemic","digital epidemiology","LongCovid","PostCovid"],"title":"New preprint: Estimating the distribution of COVID-19-susceptible, -recovered, and -vaccinated individuals in Germany up to April 2022","type":"old_news"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Annika Rose","Benjamin F.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate. Such long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data was collected over a period of two years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around 190,000 monthly active donors. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals on average experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research.","tags":["COVID-19","Datenspende","data donation project","Corona","pandemic","digital epidemiology","LongCovid","PostCovid"],"title":"New preprint: Evidence for positive long- and short-term effects of vaccinations against COVID-19 in wearable sensor metrics -- Insights from the German Corona Data Donation Project","type":"old_news"},{"authors":["Ulf Aslak","Christopher T.

Therefore, for fish populations, in temperate regions with seasonal and daily environmental oscillations, characteristic rhythms of social relationships should be pronounced. To date, most research concerning fish social networks and biorhythms has occurred in artificial laboratory environments or over confined temporal scales of days to weeks. By contrast, little is known about the social networks of wild, freely roaming fish, including how seasonal and diurnal rhythms modulate social networks over the course of a full year. The advent of high-resolution acoustic telemetry enables us to quantify detailed social interactions in the wild over time-scales sufficient to examine seasonal rhythms at whole-ecosystems scales. Our objective was to explore the rhythms of social interactions in a social fish population at various time-scales over one full year in the wild by examining high-resolution snapshots of dynamic social network. To that end, we tracked the behaviour of 36 adult common carp, Cyprinus carpio, in a 25 ha lake and constructed temporal social networks among individuals across various time-scales, where social interactions were defined by proximity. We compared the network structure to a temporally shuffled null model to examine the importance of social attraction, and checked for persistent characteristic groups (“friendships”) over time. The clustering within the carp social network tended to be more pronounced during daytime than nighttime throughout the year. Social attraction, particularly during daytime, was a key driver for interactions. Shoaling behavior substantially increased during daytime in the wintertime, whereas in summer carp interacted less frequently, but the interaction duration increased. Characteristic groups were more common in the summer months and during nighttime, where the social memory of carp lasted up to two weeks. We conclude that social relationships of carp change diurnally and seasonally. These patterns were likely driven by predator avoidance, seasonal shifts in lake temperature, visibility, forage availability and the presence of anoxic zones. The techniques we employed can be applied generally to high-resolution biotelemetry data to reveal social structures across other fish species at ecologically realistic scales.","tags":["fish","collective behavior","networks","temporal networks","contact patterns","animal behavior"],"title":"New preprint: Rhythm of relationships in a social fish over the course of a full year in the wild","type":"old_news"},{"authors":["Benjamin F.

Most recently, mobility data was extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic to study the effects of governmental policies and to inform epidemic models. Large-scale mobility is often measured using digital tools such as mobile phones. However, it remains an open question how truthfully these digital proxies represent the actual travel behavior of the general population. Here, we examine mobility datasets from multiple countries and identify two fundamentally different types of bias caused by unequal access to, and unequal usage of mobile phones. We introduce the concept of data generation bias, a previously overlooked type of bias, which is present when the amount of data that an individual produces influences their representation in the dataset. We find evidence for data generation bias in all examined datasets in that high-wealth individuals are overrepresented, with the richest 20% contributing over 50% of all recorded trips, substantially skewing the datasets. This inequality is consequential, as we find mobility patterns of different wealth groups to be structurally different, where the mobility networks of high-wealth users are denser and contain more long-range connections. To mitigate the skew, we present a framework to debias data and show how simple techniques can be used to increase representativeness. Using our approach we show how biases can severely impact outcomes of dynamic processes such as epidemic simulations, where biased data incorrectly estimates the severity and speed of disease transmission. Overall, we show that a failure to account for biases can have detrimental effects on the results of studies and urge researchers and practitioners to account for data-fairness in all future studies of human mobility.","tags":["human mobility","disease dynamics","complex networks","mobility networks","pandemics","epidemics","epidemic"],"title":"Biases in human mobility data impact epidemic modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin F.

Trotzdem sind die Impfraten im deutschsprachigen Europa aktuell viel zu niedrig für eine effektive Eindämmung des Virus.

Der Anteil der Leute, der durch Geimpfte angesteckt wird, ist erheblich kleiner: 15 Angesteckte sind Ungeimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden und 9 sind Geimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden. Es wurden also lediglich 24 Personen von Geimpften angesteckt. 91 von 100 Ansteckungen entstehen mit Beteiligung mindestens einer Person ohne Impfschutz.\nUm zu verstehen, ob neue Ansteckungen auch durch fehlenden Impfschutz getrieben werden, wenn die Impfung nur eine geringe Effektivität hat, wurde in einem zweiten Beispiel eine geringere Impfeffektivität angenommen 2. In der unteren Grafik wird eine Impfeffektivität von 50% bei über 60ig-Jährigen, 60% bei Erwachsenen bis 59 Jahren und 60% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bis 17 Jahren angenommen. Dann sehen die 100 Infektionen folgendermaßen aus: 38 von den 100 Angesteckten sind Ungeimpfte, die von anderen Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. 29 sind Geimpfte, die von Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. Es wurden also 67 Personen von Ungeimpften angesteckt. Der Anteil der Leute, der durch Geimpfte angesteckt wird, ist erheblich kleiner: 17 Angesteckte sind Ungeimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden und 16 sind Geimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden. Es wurden also lediglich 33 Neuinfizierte von Geimpften angesteckt. 84 von 100 Ansteckungen entstehen mit Beteiligung mindestens einer Person ohne Impfschutz.\nDaraus ergibt sich: An 8 bis 9 von 10 Ansteckungen sind Personen ohne Impfschutz beteiligt. Je effektiver der Impfschutz, desto weniger Ansteckungen werden durch geimpfte Personen verursacht. Die Dynamik der Pandemie wird aktuell also stark durch fehlenden oder nachlassenden, weniger effektiven Impfschutz getrieben.\nDaher empfiehlt sich: Impfquote effektiv erhöhen. Effektivität des Impfschutzes erhöhen, z.B. durch Boostern. Kontakte reduzieren, v.a. zwischen ungeimpften Personen. Ohne zusätzliche Maßnahmen ist keine baldige Besserung der Impfquote zu erwarten, da die Zuwachsrate der Impfkampagne seit Juni 2021 stagniert. Für zusätzliche Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der Impfquote besteht die Herausforderung, dass ein Großteil der ungeimpften Personen schwer erreichbar ist - z.B. laut der COSMO-Studie sind 30% der Ungeimpften zögerlich, 54% sagen, sie wollen sich auf keinen Fall impfen lassen (Stand November 2021). Vor- und Nachteile eine Impfpflicht sollten diskutiert werden. Maßnahmen, die schnell die Kontakte reduzieren, sollten zum Brechen der 4. Welle implementiert werden, da selbst ein schneller Anstieg der Impfrate erst mittelfristig weitere Wellen verhindern, nicht aber die aktuelle Welle brechen kann.\nKontakt: bfmaier@physik.hu-berlin.de\nPreprint: Germany’s current COVID-19 crisis is mainly driven by the unvaccinated\nDas theoretische Framework hinter diesen Berechnungen heisst Contribution Matrix. Die Berechnungen sind detailliert hier beschrieben: https://rocs.hu-berlin.de/publication/maier-2021- germany/maier-2021-germany.pdf\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nBeide Szenarien gehen von folgenden aktuellen Impfraten pro Altersgruppe aus: 0-11 = 0%, 12-17 = 40%, 18-59 = 72%, 60+ = 85%. Über die tatsächliche Impfeffektivität besteht wissenschaftliche Unsicherheit. Daher werden zwei verschiedene Szenarien angenommen. In Szenario A wird eine hohe Impfeffektivität von 92% bei Kindern und 72% bei Erwachsenen angenommen. Dies entspricht den Effektivitäten der Periode Oktober 2021 für symptomatisches COVID-19 (RKI Situationsbericht vom 11.11.2021). Im Modell werden jedoch Impfeffektivitäten gegen Infektion angenommen, die üblicherweise geringer sind als gegen symptomatisches COVID-19. Diese Effektivitätsschätzung ist daher eine optimistische Schätzung und dient dies als mögliche Obergrenze. Die niedrigeren Impfeffktivitäten gegen Infektion (Szenario B) sind in Übereinstimmung mit Daten aus Großbritannien gewählt (50% bei über 60ig-Jährigen, 60% bei Erwachsenen bis 59 Jahren und 60% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bis 17 Jahren). In Großbritannien wurde vorwiegend mit AstraZeneca geimpft. Dieser Impfstoff gilt in der Literatur als weniger effektiv. Daher dienen diese Werte im Modell als Schätzung für niedrige Impfeffektivität gegen Infektion. Die Ansteckungs-Zahlen beschreiben die geschätzten Anteile der Infektionswege an der totalen effektiven Reproduktionszahl (Reff).

One possible response is to raise awareness for and resilience against such manipulative strategies through psychological inoculation. Two online experiments (total ) demonstrated that a short, simple intervention prompting participants to reflect on an attribute of their own personality—by completing a short personality questionnaire—boosted their ability to accurately identify ads that were targeted at them by up to 26 percentage points. Accuracy increased even without personalized feedback, but merely providing a description of the targeted personality dimension did not improve accuracy.

Relying on empirical results, we find an expected outbreak size reduction on the order of a few percent at best. While the intervention may aid the manual tracing process, we argue that countries should concentrate on other means to contain COVID-19 outbreaks.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the abstract:\nDigital contact tracing applications have been introduced in many countries to aid in the containment of COVID-19 outbreaks. Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). Yet, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs, and the total effect of digital contact tracing remains elusive. Based on the results of empirical studies and modeling efforts, we show that digital contact tracing apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages up until now, at best. We show that this poor impact can be attributed to a combination of low participation rates, a non-flexible reliance on symptom-based testing, low engagement of participants, and delays between testing and test result upload. We find that contact tracing does not change the epidemic threshold and exclusively prevents more cases during the supercritical phase of an epidemic, making it unfit as a tool to prevent outbreaks. Locally clustered contact structures may increase the intervention’s efficacy, but only if the number of contacts per individual is homogeneously distributed, a condition usually not found in contact networks. Our results suggest that policy makers cannot rely on digital contact tracing to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar diseases.\n","date":1624924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624924800,"objectID":"de0034aa1f90a4c8533852c68e974584","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/old_news/tracing_paper/","publishdate":"2021-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/old_news/tracing_paper/","section":"old_news","summary":"Our preprint \u0026ldquo;Digital contact tracing contributes little to COVID-19 outbreak containment\u0026rdquo; is out and available.\nAs digital contact tracing apps raised the hope that they may be efficient enough to contain outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs, we analyzed its success.","tags":["COVID-19","modelling","digital-contact-tracing","non-pharmaceutical-interventions","containment"],"title":"Preprint out: Digital contact tracing contributes little to COVID-19 outbreak containment","type":"old_news"},{"authors":["Susi Gottwald","Tashin Talbot","Adrian Pelcaru","Paul Buttkus","Marc Wiedermann","Jakob Kolb"],"categories":[],"content":"Our team keeps growing!\nWe warmly welcome:\nAdrian Pelcaru Paul Buttkus Tashin Talbot Marc Wiedemann Jakob Kolb We are very happy that they are on board.

How can transparency and autonomy be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates.

All other worries tend to decline, especially theconcern about overburdening the health system.

Despite increasing efforts, the dynamics leading to the emergence of these phenomena stay unclear. We propose a model that introduces the dynamics of radicalization, as a reinforcing mechanism driving the evolution to extreme opinions from moderate initial conditions. Inspired by empirical findings on social interaction dynamics, we consider agents characterized by heterogeneous activities and homophily. We show that the transition between a global consensus and emerging radicalized states is mostly governed by social influence and by the controversialness of the topic discussed.

To identify possible transmission routes, we applied combined genomics and contact-network modeling to retrospectively evaluate routine VRE screening data generated by the infection control program of a hemato-oncology unit. Over 1 year, a total of 111 VRE isolates from 111 patients were collected by anal swabs in a tertiary care hospital in Southern Germany. All isolated VRE were whole-genome sequenced, followed by different in-depth bioinformatics analyses including genotyping and determination of phylogenetic relations, aiming to evaluate a standardized workflow. Patient movement data were used to overlay sequencing data to infer transmission events and strain dynamics over time. A predominant clone harboring vanB and exhibiting genotype ST117/CT469 (n = 67) was identified. Our comprehensive combined analyses suggested intra-hospital spread, especially of clone ST117/CT469, despite of extensive screening, single room placement, and contact isolation. A new interactive tool to visualize these complex data was designed. Furthermore, a patient-contact network-modeling approach was developed, which indicates both the periodic import of the clone into the hospital and its spread within the hospital due to patient movements. The analyzed spread of VRE was most likely due to placement of patients in the same room prior to positivity of screening. We successfully demonstrated the added value for this combined strategy to extract well-founded knowledge from interdisciplinary data sources. The combination of patient-contact modeling and high-resolution typing unraveled the transmission dynamics within the hospital department and, additionally, a constant VRE influx over time.","tags":["contact networks","complex networks","antibiotic resistance"],"title":"Comprehensive integrated NGS-based surveillance and contact-network modeling unravels transmission dynamics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a high-risk population within a tertiary care hospital","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024271,"objectID":"bca1094d988a5a4b6fded9c2571a2aad","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2020-digitale/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:11.288512Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2020-digitale/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital epidemiology is a new and rapidly growing field.

Standing as an example, Bayesian multidimensional scaling (MDS) can help scientists learn viral trajectories through space-time, but its computational burden prevents its wider use. Crucial MDS model calculations scale quadratically in the number of observations. We partially mitigate this limitation through massive parallelization using multi-core central processing units, instruction-level vectorization and graphics processing units (GPUs). Fitting the MDS model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, GPUs can deliver more than 100-fold speedups over serial calculations and thus extend Bayesian MDS to a big data setting. To illustrate, we employ Bayesian MDS to infer the rate at which different seasonal influenza virus subtypes use worldwide air traffic to spread around the globe. We examine 5392 viral sequences and their associated 14 million pairwise distances arising from the number of commercial airline seats per year between viral sampling locations. To adjust for shared evolutionary history of the viruses, we implement a phylogenetic extension to the MDS model and learn that subtype H3N2 spreads most effectively, consistent with its epidemic success relative to other seasonal influenza subtypes. Finally, we provide MassiveMDS, an open-source, stand-alone C++ library and rudimentary R package, and discuss program design and high-level implementation with an emphasis on important aspects of computing architecture that become relevant at scale.","tags":["Bayesian","phylogeography"],"title":"Massive parallelization boosts big Bayesian multidimensional scaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","B Mørch Mønsted","P Hövel","S Lehmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1552608000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548865867,"objectID":"247d994917a37365f227b1dc89021d0d","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2019-accelerating/","publishdate":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2019-accelerating/","section":"publication","summary":"With news pushed to smart phones in real time and social media reactions spreading across the globe in seconds, the public discussion can appear accelerated and temporally fragmented.

The question of why modular hierarchical (MH) organizations are so ubiquitous in nature, however, has received less attention. One hypothesis is that MH topologies may provide an optimal structure for certain dynamical processes. We revisit a MH network model that interpolates, using a single parameter, between two known network topologies: from strong hierarchical modularity to an Erdős–Rényi random connectivity structure. We show that this model displays a similar small-world effect as the Kleinberg model, where the connection probability between nodes decays algebraically with distance. We find that there is an optimal structure, in both models, for which the pair-averaged first passage time (FPT) and mean cover time of a discrete-time random walk are minimal, and provide a heuristic explanation for this effect. Finally, we show that analytic predictions for the pair-averaged FPT based on an effective medium approximation fail to reproduce these minima, which implies that their presence is due to a network structure effect.","tags":["complex networks","random walks","first passage time"],"title":"Modular hierarchical and power-law small-world networks bear structural optima for minimal first passage times and cover time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":null,"content":"Complex Systems in Biology, Winter 2022 Complex Systems in Biology, Winter 2021 ","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/courses/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"sdölfkasdölfk.","tags":null,"title":"Courses \u0026 Teaching","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThe Legal Notice of TU Dresden applies with the following amendments:\nRESPONSIBILITIES If you have any questions regarding content, please contact: Dirk Brockmann Technische Universität Dresden DE – 01062 Dresden Email: dirk.brockmann@tu-dresden.de Telephone: +49 351 463-33199\nTechnical implementation:\nTechnische Universität Dresden Institution / Department Center for Synergy of Systems Georg-Schumann-Straße 7A 01069 Dresden Head: Dirk Brockmann Email: dirk.brockmann@tu-dresden.de\nDATA PROTECTION DECLARATION TU Dresden processes personal data for the use of the public website https://synosys.github.io).

These complex systems present challenges in terms of modeling and policy development. A lethal tick-borne infectious disease, the Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), is a relevant example of that. The current increase of human cases of BSF has been associated with the presence and expansion of the capybara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, amplifier host for the agent Rickettsia rickettsii and primary host for the tick vector Amblyomma sculptum. We introduce a stochastic dynamical model that captures the spatial distribution of capybaras and ticks to gain a better understanding of the spatial spread of the R. rickettsii and potentially predict future epidemic outcomes. We implemented a reaction-diffusion process in which individuals were divided into classes denoting their state with respect to the disease. The model considered bidirectional movements between base and destination locations limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. We performed systematic stochastic simulations and numerical analysis of the model and investigate the impact of potential interventions to mitigate the spatial spread of the disease. The mobility of capybaras and their attached ticks was significantly influenced by the birth rate of capybaras and therefore, disease propagation velocity was higher in places with higher carrying capacity. Some geographical barriers, generated for example by riparian reforesting, can impede the spatial spread of BSF. The results of this work will allow the formulation of public actions focused on the prevention of BSF human cases.","tags":["Rickettsia rickettsii","infectious disease dynamics","mobility"],"title":"Hosts mobility and spatial spread of Rickettsia rickettsii","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024269,"objectID":"e62c26c741f7973950687af8e398ba8c","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2018-human/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:09.118628Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2018-human/","section":"publication","summary":"Disease dynamics is a complex phenomenon and in order to address these questions expertises from many disciplines need to be integrated.

We propose and analyze a dynamical model in which individuals that are affected by one transmissible agent A exhibit a higher than baseline propensity of being affected by a second agent B and vice versa. The model is a natural extension of the traditional susceptible-infected-susceptible model used for modeling single contagion processes. We show that cooperativity changes the dynamics of the system considerably when cooperativity is strong. The system exhibits discontinuous phase transitions not observed in single agent contagion, multi-stability, a separation of the traditional epidemic threshold into different thresholds for inception and extinction as well as hysteresis. These properties are robust and are corroborated by stochastic simulations on lattices and generic network topologies. Finally, we investigate wave propagation and transients in a spatially extended version of the model and show that especially for intermediate values of baseline reproduction ratios the system is characterized by various types of wave-front speeds.

We find that, in line with other temporal characterizations of human activity, the signing process is typically non-Poissonian and non-homogeneous in time. However, this process exhibits anomalously high memory for human activity, possibly indicating that synchronized external influence or contagion play and important role. More interestingly, we find clear differences in the characteristics of the inter-event time distributions depending on the total number of signatures that petitions receive, independently of the total duration of the petitions. Specifically, popular petitions that attract a large volume of signatures exhibit more variance in the distribution of inter-event times than unpopular petitions with only a few signatures, which could be considered an indication that the former are more bursty. However, petitions with large signature volume are less bursty according to measures that consider the time ordering of inter-event times.

Responding to the demand for connectivity, innovative third-party players have proposed solutions that have been widely adopted by field users of the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay. The experience associated with the utilisation of these systems, which facilitate the monitoring of wide laboratory networks, stressed the need for a more global and comprehensive approach to diagnostic connectivity. In addition to facilitating the reporting of test results, the mobility of digital information allows the sharing of information generated in programme settings. When they become easily accessible, these data can be used to improve patient care, disease surveillance and drug discovery. They should therefore be considered as a public health good. We list several examples of concrete initiatives that should allow data sources to be combined to improve the understanding of the epidemic, support the operational response and, finally, accelerate TB elimination.

To address this need we developed a computational model capturing the current understanding of how individual metastatic tumor cells and immune cells sense and contribute to the tumor environment, which in turn enabled us to investigate the complex, collective behavior of these systems. Surprisingly, we discovered that tumor escape from immune control was enhanced by the existence of small differences (or heterogeneities) in the responses of individual immune cells to their environment, as well as by heterogeneities in the way that cells and the molecules they secrete are arranged in space. These conclusions held true over a range of model formulations, suggesting that this is a general feature of these tumor-immune networks.

These methods are time-consuming and suffer from biased data collected slowly in patient interviews. Here we apply a recently developed, network-theoretical method to identify the spatial origin of food-borne disease outbreaks. Thereby, the network captures the transportation routes of contaminated foods. The technique only requires spatial information on case reports regularly collected by public health institutions and a model for the underlying food distribution network. The approach is based on the idea of replacing the conventional geographic distance with an effective distance that is derived from the topological structure of the underlying food distribution network. We show that this approach can efficiently identify most probable epicenters of food-borne disease outbreaks. We assess and discuss the method in the context of the 2011 EHEC epidemic.

Relatively little effort has gone into understanding how salient network extraction methods perform in the face of noisy or incomplete networks. We study this problem by comparing how the salient features extracted by two popular methods change when networks are perturbed, either by deleting nodes or links, or by randomly rewiring links.

The complexity of modern human communication, the ease of long-distance movement, and increased interaction across political borders complicate the operational definition and assessment of geographic borders that optimally reflect the multi-scale nature of today's human connectivity patterns. What border structures emerge directly from the interplay of scales in human interactions is an open question.

We propose two computational techniques for extracting these borders and for quantifying their strength. We find that effective borders only partially overlap with existing administrative borders, and show that some of the strongest mobility borders exist in unexpected regions. We show that the observed structures cannot be generated by gravity models for human traffic.

In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic10, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Lévy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.","tags":["human mobility","scaling laws","anomalous diffusion"],"title":"The scaling laws of human travel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Hufnagel","Dirk Brockmann","T Geisel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1098144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1098144000,"objectID":"ba3cc9ad592522334c00eb03f32cacd2","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/hufnagel-2004-forecast/","publishdate":"2021-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hufnagel-2004-forecast/","section":"publication","summary":"The rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome demonstrated the potential threat an infectious disease poses in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.

As an example, generalized diffusion in a double-well potential is considered.","tags":["lévy flights","anomalous diffusion","random walks"],"title":"Lévy flights in external force fields: from models to equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"45f5802f15b09102c9be5a4725c1261b","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/katharina/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/katharina/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0e0f305e01e7d4fe986622bab75b036a","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/marc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/marc/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fe78c156d670f7f4d28948551a701f32","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/pascal/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/pascal/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"29fd75f70a05fa056b4b74e9da895e48","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/susi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/susi/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cb690a3cda6b5219f02487370495aee9","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/dirk/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/dirk/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mini CV","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ef80b40d99f99b482cb9e9ed214e7eb3","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/katharina/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/katharina/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Skills","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b36fe5d11805fa89e2305a20bfd8e29c","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/pascal/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/pascal/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Skills","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ed65427826049ac607689f98e44fae6e","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/authors/susi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/susi/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Skills","type":"authors"}]
