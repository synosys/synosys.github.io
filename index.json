He studied physics and mathematics at the University of Göttingen, Germany where he received his PhD in theoretical physics.\nBefore becoming founding director of SynoSys he was professor at the Departments of Biology and Physics at Humboldt University of Berlin and led a research team at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany’s national public health institute. Between 2008 and 2013 he was professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University and faculty member of the Northwestern\u0026rsquo;s Institute on Complex Systems.\nDirk has worked on various topics, ranging from computational neuroscience and anomalous diffusion in biological and physical systems to infectious disease dynamics, human mobility, network theory and citizen science.\nHe pioneered the analysis of mass data obtained in natural experiments and understanding human behavior based on data collected by digital devices. During the COVID-19 pandemic he launched the German Data Donation Project, in which more than 500,000 donors provided data collected on their smart-watches and wearable devices on a daily basis for more than 2,5 years, the largest dataset of this kind in public hands worldwide.\nDirk believes in the value of anti-disciplinary science, the intentional breach of traditional scientific boundaries and is particularly interested in bridging the gap between biological and social sciences and the philosophy of complexity science. He coined the phrase \u0026ldquo;Get lost in Science!\u0026rdquo; to stress the importance of explorative research as opposed to hypothesis driven research, using a compass instead of a map for navigating the unknown.\nIn 2017 Dirk launched the Complexity Explorables, a collection of web-based interactive models of famous and less famous complex systems to illustrate the beauty of complex dynamical phenomena and teach young students about these systems.\nCurrently, Dirk is most interested in the design of citizen science projects, in which the general public can participate in scientific endeavours via digital tools and technologies. He is also interested in the emergence of cooperation, mutualism and fungi.\nDirk’s work has been covered extensively by the media and the press, e.g. the New York Times, the Washington Post, the BBC, various TV shows in the United States, Europe and Germany. During the pandemic he was a regular expert guest in numerous TV talk shows and the main German TV news shows.\nSelected Publications Citizen data sovereignty is key to wearables and wellness data reuse for the common good.

We aim to understand how organisms adapt in heterogeneous, network-like environments that closely resemble real-world scenarios.\nClonal interference (CI) occurs in asexual populations when multiple beneficial mutations arise and compete, unable to combine through recombination. While CI has been studied in well-mixed or simple spatial structures, its behavior in complex, heterogeneous environments remains largely unexplored.\nKey Research Aims:\nUnderstanding CI in Highly Heterogeneous Environments: We investigate how diverse network topologies influence clonal interference. Identifying Key Structural Components: We aim to pinpoint specific elements of network structures that significantly impact adaptive processes, understanding which features promote faster adaptation and which areas are likely sources of adaptive mutations. Shaping and Controlling Adaptive Evolution: By understanding how network structures influence evolution, we seek to develop strategies for potentially guiding adaptive processes in complex environments. Developing Analytical Tools: We\u0026rsquo;re working to create and refine mathematical and computational tools that effectively model and predict evolutionary dynamics in intricate systems, bridging network theory, evolutionary biology, and complex systems science. The insights gained from our research have potential applications across a wide range of fields. In epidemiology, our understanding of how pathogens evolve in structured host populations could inform more effective disease management strategies. Conservation biologists might use our findings to guide habitat management practices, supporting species adaptation and resilience in fragmented environments. Our work could also lead to improved bioprocess designs by accounting for how environmental structure affects microbial evolution.\nBeyond these direct applications, the principles we uncover might have broader, more speculative implications. For instance, our approaches to mutation spread in biological networks could provide insights into how content goes viral on social media platforms with diverse user structures. The competition between genetic strains in our research might parallel how ideas, innovations and cultural practices propagate through social and professional networks.\nAs we continue to explore the intricate interplay between network complexity and evolutionary dynamics, we\u0026rsquo;re not merely advancing theoretical knowledge. We\u0026rsquo;re developing a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how adaptation occurs in complex systems. This research has the potential to open new avenues for managing and harnessing evolutionary processes in various fields, spanning from biology to the social sciences. By bridging the gap between network theory and evolutionary biology, we\u0026rsquo;re paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of how information – be it genetic, cultural, or technological – spreads and competes in our interconnected world.\n","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"dd77417e3997f1fdc9e1e1cebccb6a58","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/project/clonal_interference/","publishdate":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/clonal_interference/","section":"project","summary":"Our research group explores the intricate relationship between complex environmental structures and evolutionary processes, focusing on clonal interference in asexual populations.

The recent COVID-19 outbreak and its rapid global spread highlight the urgent need for tools that can limit the spreading of infectious diseases at the earliest stage to prevent global pandemics. Previous research has suggested the potential to detect COVID-19 infections through the observation of physiological alterations occurring after the onset of the disease, including elevated resting heart rates, extended sleep durations, and decreased physical activity. Wearable sensors, equipped to monitor these changes, in conjunction with machine learning algorithms trained on data from these sensors, could identify these variations, thus providing a method to quickly classify individuals as infected. Utilizing wearable sensor data from the Corona Data Donation Project, which encompasses resting heart rate, step count, and sleep duration time series from over 120,000 voluntary participants, a Logistic Regression model was developed for the classification of submitted COVID-19 test results. This model achieved classification success, as evidenced by a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.58, precision of 0.26, and recall of 0.54. The implementation of the catch22 feature set for feature extraction from the submitted wearable sensor data enhanced the interpretability of the classification algorithm. It also enabled a more detailed analysis of the specific physiological changes used to differentiate individuals testing positive or negative for COVID-19. This study emphasizes the capability of predicting COVID-19 across large cohorts and underscores the value of employing infectious disease prediction models based on wearable sensor data as an additional public health tool. The LR model presented in Fig. 1 demonstrated prediction capabilities for COVID-19 test results surpassing random chance, thereby facilitating the early detection of this infectious disease. Additionally, the incorporation of catch22 features into the feature engineering process enhanced the interpretability of the classification decisions made by the model. The predictive LR model shown in Fig. 1 demonstrated satisfactory performance, notable given the voluntary nature of data submission, the impossibility of verifying correct and constant wear of devices, reliance on daily averages, absence of precise test and symptom onset dates, and the utilization of multiple devices across a broad cohort. The present study introduced a predictive model that has been trained on a considerable cohort size, addressing concerns from existing research about models only trained on significantly smaller cohorts. Additionally, this study tackled the issue of geographic underrepresentation by developing a predictive model for COVID-19 classification with data donated outside the United States, addressing other concerns in existing literature. Additionally confirmatory models have been developed which showed performances consistent with existing literature, validating its efficacy in confirming COVID-19 infections within this study’s framework. Enhancements in confirmatory capability were noted with the increasing days included after a COVID-19 test submission, indicating that a longer observational period bolsters the model’s confirmatory power. Employing interpretable catch22 feature engineering provided clarity in the classification process and verified that the detected signals coincide with physiological responses to COVID-19 infection, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. This consistency in signal detection across the models and their alignment with other research underscores the catch22 features’ ability to accurately capture vital data signals from wearable sensor data. Conclusively, this study proposes a combined approach of catch22 feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms as an effective strategy in combating the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Highlighting that this methodology could be especially valuable in the initial stages of a pandemic, where traditional methods might be unavailable. Thus, it offers an essential addition to public health resources. This study highlights the potential of utilizing wearable sensor data, combined with automated feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms, for the detection and confirmation of diseases like COVID-19. With further advancements machine learning approaches to detect illnesses like COVID-19 using wearable sensor data could significantly improve the readiness and response to future public health crise\nFig. 2 - Permutation Feature Importance for the test dataset for the Confirmatory LR: Focusing on features that led to a mean increase in model performance (increase in Geometric Mean (GM)).

In this project we investigate the growth of filamentous fungi by creating and investigating mathematical growth models. We cooperate with experimental biologists from the aguilar ecology lab who have a profound knowledge of the growth patterns of different fungal species (see Fig.1). In a first network analysis of our collaborators, they identified that some network traits vary most in between species, as for example the meshedness (how different the network is from a fully-connected one without crossing edges).\nFig.1 - Different species of hyphal growing fungi and the reconstruction of the network they are forming. Figure is adapted from Aguilar-Trigueros et al. (2022). We approach the problem from a modeling perspective, that means we build an agent based model, which is motivated from real fungi. In our model each each agent represents the tip of a hyphen and the tip as well as the whole hyphen release an enzyme. This enzyme diffuses though the environment and other tips/agents can sense the local concentration and gradient. This is all the information the tip has about its environment, i.e. only local information is allowed. New Tips/Agents are created either by an apical branching event, at which one tip splits in two, or by a lateral branching event, where from the lower half of a tip compartment muliple branches grow perpendicular to the local growth direction. By varying some fundamental parameters of the model as the diffusion coefficient, the enzyme release rate or the number of lateral branches, different shapes can emerge as shown if Fig. 2.\nFig.2 - Depending on the parameters, the mycelium grows densely (A) or less densely (B, C) if for example the enzyme release rate is increased (B) or the septation rule is adapted (C). The enzyme in the environment (orange and red background color) inhibit the growth of the mycelium, thus the mycelium is more responsive to its own form (compare A with B). In (A, B) the septation and lateral branching form always two septas and branches at each septation event. In (C) 6 septa and branches are formed during an septation event. While the quadrants 2-4 show the concentration on a variable linear scale (bottom colorbar), the 1st quadrant uses a fixed logarithmic scale (top colorbar) to enable a fair comparison between simulations. Our goals are now to reproduce key structural properties of real fungal species with a model as simple as possible, study the statistical properties of the different phases of the model and what task the fungi can perform at each phase best. This is exciting, especially because we are able to switch between theory, modelling and experiments. The big picture is of course the role of the fungi in the ecosystems in connection with their growth strategies.\n","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"60e949c48bacc48de8537f88d948d500","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/","publishdate":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fungal_growth/","section":"project","summary":"Fungi interact in a mycorrhizal symbiosis with plants or are simple decomposers of organic matter.

It is likely that our connectivity has not reached its peak yet, since for example the number of globally scheduled air passengers increased yearly by about 6% between 2004 and 2019. The connectivity has huge consequences on the propagation of disease since with passengers comes everything that sticks to them, such as bacteria, viruses, earth clumps beneath their shoes etc.\nThis project crosses the fields of network science, transportation, mobility and disease dynamics and its an offspring of the idea to not use the conventional distance (in meter, miles, feet \u0026hellip; pick your unit) as a metric but an effective distance that is based on the mobility between regions. When $P(B | A)$ is the probability to travel to B from A (which is computed from mobility fluxes) than the effective distance is $ d _{\\text{eff}} (A | B) = d_0 - log (P(i| n_0)) $. In the seminal paper by Brockmann and Helbing (2013) effective distance $d _{\\text{eff}}$ was shown to linearly correlate with the arrival time of diseases as shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 2 - The shortest path tree based on the effective distance with the airport of Hong Kong as origin (A) and how an pandemic spreads around the globe (B). While the spread on the world map seems rather random, you see a nice circular wave spreading in the effective distance tree, illustrating the linear correlation to disease arrival times. Adapted from Brockmann and Helbing. In our recent paperKlamser et al. (2024) we deepen the connection between the effective distance shortest path tree, spreading dynamics and mobility. We present a way to estimate the passenger flow between any two airports (including those without direct connections) given that we only know the number and maximal capacity of planes (see illustrative example in Fig. 3). At the end the method allows us to estimate the number of infected passenger leaving B when we know the number of infected that entered A. Thus we know the risk of importation, why it is named import risk method.\nFig. 3 - Import Risk Example: 100 infected passengers board planes at airport X en route to destination airports elsewhere in the network, going through transit airports in the process. The relative import risk at a given destination is the fraction of the 100 individuals that entered at airport X and exited at that destination airport (red). The mechanistic idea behind the import risk method is to let a random walker start at node B of the WAN and exit at each node with a probability derived from the effective distance shortest path tree. The final fraction of times it leaves at node A is the import risk probability. Now this method is parameter free and motivated by disease dynamics, but in the same time it provides a method to estimate mobility on a global scale. The mobility estimation is a classic task in transportation science with well established models as the gravity model (proposed in 1946 by Zipf). A core aspect of our import risk paper Klamser et al. (2024) is to compare our method to established mobility models. We found that our approach outperforms the established models, and the crazy thing is, that our method is parameter free, while the gravity model always needs parameter estimation (one needs to know the real mobility flow beforehand). This holds true if we check the prediction quality of for the 10 countries with the highest import probability, which especially important for disease propagation since these countries are the one that should increase their passenger control (shown in Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 - Mobility model comparisons for top 10 import countries: The well established gravity model with exponential (A) and power-law (B) distance decay, the parameter free radiation model (C) and our import risk model (D). Each dot is a country that is among the 10 countries with the highest import probability from another country (10 target countries x 183 source countries). A true or false positive (T.Pos. or F. Pos.) means that the country is or is not among the 10 countries with the highest reference import probability. A false negative (F. Neg.) means that it belongs according to reference it is among the top 10 but was not detected by the respective model. Figure adapted from Klamser et al. (2024). We applied the measure during COVID-19 to estimate the countries that have been reached by Omicron without it beeing detected here. And in a big cooperation with great collegues that have been put together by Manlio De Domenico we have developed and validated a framework (Klamser and d\u0026rsquo;Andrea et al. (2023))that can estimate from sparse and noisy samples via phylogenetic analysis the time when the variant first occured in the origin country, how it spreads across the globe with our import risk model, and how the countries are affected by a disease dynamic model. We were even able to smash everything into one number, which we call the pandemic delay, that estimates how long it takes for a new emerging variant to make out 10% of all current cases in a respective country. It revealed that only by combining mobility data with a phylogenetic estimate of the reproduction number, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly assessed relative to each other.\n","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"90aa0bf3a754f9c0decdc0131be0ae23","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/project/import_risk/","publishdate":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/import_risk/","section":"project","summary":"Our globalized world is strongly connected, on the small scale by buses, trains, cars, and on the largest, global scale by the Worldwide Air transportation Network (WAN).

In contrast, entertaining content and positive language was used for socializing and attention. Original and political content featuring outrage and anger was more likely to be subsequently retweeted by others.

We find that older age, higher analytic thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Older age and higher analytical thinking skills are also associated with a false-news bias (caution).

You could study how their language has developed over the years and look for clues about what works: A coherent pattern would indicate an adaptation to the changing system. In the present study, the marketplace in question is the online digital environment, the market cries are news headlines, the vendors are content producers (journalists and editors), the consumers are readers, and the currency is their limited attention. In the digital age, large amounts of content can be produced quickly and inexpensively, and transmitted and stored with high fidelity (Acerbi, 2019). From an economic perspective this represents a contestable market (Munger, 2020): because up-front costs are low, entry to this market is potentially open to many more content producers. An abundance of content means increased competition for limited attention, fiercer algorithmic, social and personal selection, and a higher turnover of content (Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2019), a situation aptly described as an attention economy (Simon et al., 1971). With an overabundance of content, only a small fraction of content eventually reaches the user, even less is ultimately consumed and engaged with (see González-Bailón et al., 2023 for the funnel of engagement).

It reduces the complex spreading patterns of a pandemic to a wave-like propagation from the outbreak country, establishing a linear relationship to the arrival time of the unmitigated spread of a disease. However, in the early stages of an outbreak, what concerns decision-makers in countries is understanding the relative risk of active cases arriving in their country—essentially, the likelihood that an active case boarding an airplane at the outbreak location will reach them. While there are data-fitted models available to estimate these risks, accurate mechanistic, parameter-free models are still lacking. Therefore, we introduce the ‘import risk’ model in this study, which defines import probabilities using the effective-distance framework. The model assumes that airline passengers are distributed along the shortest path tree that starts at the outbreak’s origin. In combination with a random walk, we account for all possible paths, thus inferring predominant connecting flights. Our model outperforms other mobility models, such as the radiation and gravity model with varying distance types, and it improves further if additional geographic information is included. The import risk model’s precision increases for countries with stronger connections within the WAN, and it reveals a geographic distance dependence that implies a pull- rather than a push-dynamic in the distribution process.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","mobility"],"title":"Inferring country-specific import risk of diseases from the world air transportation network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705190400,"objectID":"824b8eccdd75c3132007d932d9b8d73b","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/project/complexity_explorables/","publishdate":"2024-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/complexity_explorables/","section":"project","summary":"This project is designed for people interested in complex systems and complex dynamical processes.

Therefore, for fish populations in temperate regions with seasonal and daily environmental oscillations, characteristic rhythms of social relationships should be pronounced. To date, most research concerning fish social networks and biorhythms has occurred in artificial laboratory environments or over confined temporal scales of days to weeks. Little is known about the social networks of wild, freely roaming fish, including how seasonal and diurnal rhythms modulate social networks over the course of a full year. The advent of high-resolution acoustic telemetry enables us to quantify detailed social interactions in the wild over time-scales sufficient to examine seasonal rhythms at whole-ecosystems scales. Our objective was to explore the rhythms of social interactions in a social fish population at various time-scales over one full year in the wild by examining high-resolution snapshots of a dynamic social network.\n\n Methods \n\nTo that end, we tracked the behaviour of 36 adult common carp, Cyprinus carpio, in a 25 ha lake and constructed temporal social networks among individuals across various time-scales, where social interactions were defined by proximity. We compared the network structure to a temporally shuffled null model to examine the importance of social attraction, and checked for persistent characteristic groups over time.\n\n Results \n\nThe clustering within the carp social network tended to be more pronounced during daytime than nighttime throughout the year. Social attraction, particularly during daytime, was a key driver for interactions. Shoaling behavior substantially increased during daytime in the wintertime, whereas in summer carp interacted less frequently, but the interaction duration increased. Therefore, smaller, characteristic groups were more common in the summer months and during nighttime, where the social memory of carp lasted up to two weeks. Conclusions We conclude that social relationships of carp change diurnally and seasonally. These patterns were likely driven by predator avoidance, seasonal shifts in lake temperature, visibility, forage availability and the presence of anoxic zones. The techniques we employed can be applied generally to high-resolution biotelemetry data to reveal social structures across other fish species at ecologically realistic scales.","tags":["Fish","Movement","Ecology"],"title":"Rhythm of relationships in a social fish over the course of a full year in the wild","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Annika Rose","Benjamin F.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term changes in personal health and health-related wellbeing after a SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a subject of debate. Such effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration around a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data were collected over a period of 2 years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with around 190,000 monthly active participants. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals, on average, experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large-scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Evidence for positive long- and short-term effects of vaccinations against COVID-19 in wearable sensor metrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pascal Klamser","Valeria d’Andrea","Francesco Di Lauro","Adrian Zachariae","Sebastiano Bontorin","Antonello Di Nardo","Matthew Hall","Benjamin F.

The potential threat posed by its rapid spread in Germany was, at the time, difficult to predict. We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered infectious-disease model that included information about variant-specific and waning VEs based on empirical data available at the time. Compared to other approaches, our method aimed for minimal structural and computational complexity and therefore enabled us to respond to changes in the situation in a more agile manner while still being able to analyze the potential influence of (non-)pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the emerging crisis. Thus, the model allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs), the efficacy of contact reduction strategies, and the success of the booster vaccine rollout campaign. We expected a large cumulative number of infections with the VOC Omicron in Germany with ICU occupancy likely remaining below capacity, nevertheless, even without additional NPIs. The projected figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid-February and mid-March. Most surprisingly, our model showed that early, strict, and short contact reductions could have led to a strong ‘rebound’ effect with high incidences after the end of the respective NPIs, despite a potentially successful booster campaign. The results presented here informed legislation in Germany. The methodology developed in this study might be used to estimate the impact of future waves of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Modeling the impact of the Omicron infection wave in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin F.

Yet, reliable estimates regarding population-wide susceptibility were of considerable interest: Since both previous infection and vaccination reduce the risk of severe disease, a low share of immunologically naïve individuals lowers the probability of further severe outbreaks, given that emerging variants do not escape the acquired susceptibility reduction. Here, we estimate the share of immunologically naïve individuals by age group for each of the sixteen German federal states by integrating an infectious-disease model based on weekly incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the national surveillance system and vaccine uptake, as well as assumptions regarding under-ascertainment. We estimate a median share of 5.6% of individuals in the German population have neither been in contact with vaccine nor any variant up to 31 May 2022 (quartile range [2.5%–8.5%]). For the adult population at higher risk of severe disease, this figure is reduced to 3.8% [1.6%–5.9%] for ages 18–59 and 2.1% [1.0%–3.4%] for ages 60 and above. However, estimates vary between German states mostly due to heterogeneous vaccine uptake. Excluding Omicron infections from the analysis, 16.3% [14.1%–17.9%] of the population in Germany, across all ages, are estimated to be immunologically naïve, highlighting the large impact the first two Omicron waves had until the beginning of summer in 2022. The method developed here might be useful for similar estimations in other countries or future outbreaks of other infectious diseases.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Estimating the share of SARS-CoV-2- immunologically naïve individuals in Germany up to June 2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

When poorly deployed, these resources are misspent and have an inefficient impact. In a dynamic environment where sources of outbreaks are ever-changing, how to optimally deploy these resources is difficult to identify and can moreover change over time. In addressment, we outline and test network-driven framework that accounts for underlying patient mobility, and outbreak dynamics in hospitals to predict the temporal and spatial arrival of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) outbreaks.\nMethods We reconstructed CPE-outbreaks using a novel formulation based on transmission-dynamics, contact-interactions, and microbiology data. For each outbreak, we then examine their spatial evolution and, using background hospital population movement (entire patient population from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust between 2018-08-17 and 2022-02-03), we predict the arrival times of new CPE cases across wards.\nFindings The background mobility-network contained ward-transitions from 181,512 patients (178 wards). Based on the construction, the network comprises a single giant component and acts as a medium for disease transmission. For the results of a fitted regression predicting outbreak arrival, we included locational attributes, in addition to network distances. Overall, we found that effective distance (a graphbased path measure shown previously epidemiologically predictive) contained unique predictive power compared to edge weight. However, the effective distance could be complemented by information regarding patient demographics (Age and Sex) of patient transfers; their predictive power is suggestive of specific sub-population mobility as more important drivers of CPE.\nConclusion We investigated a network-driven framework showing the potential to anticipate arrival-times of hospital CPE outbreaks. In including additional information, we also showed how specific hospital population movements were key drivers of CPE. In furthering our results, we next plan to investigate additional diseases, validate our findings beyond our current dataset, and explore further locational attributes.","tags":["COVID-19","Corona","pandemic","Omicron","modell","Modellierung","modelling"],"title":"Reconstructing and predicting the spatial evolution of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D J.

First, on average 36% of the times participants attempted opening a target app, they closed that app again after one sec interfered. Second, over the course of 6 wk, users attempted to open target apps 37% less than in the first week. In sum, one sec decreased users’ actual opening of target apps by 57% after six consecutive weeks. Afterward, participants also reported spending less time with their apps and indicated increased satisfaction with their consumption. To disentangle one sec’s effects, we tested its three psychological features in a preregistered online experiment (N = 500) that measured the consumption of real and viral social media video clips. We found that providing the additional option to dismiss the consumption attempt had the strongest effect.

Using data from adults in Germany (N = 29,355) assessed between October 2021 and February 2022, we investigated factors associated with self-reported compliance in both private and working life and how these relate to each other. The results indicate that private compliance was stronger among older individuals and females; among those who worried more about the pandemic situation and assumed that infection was more severe; among those who trusted the government more; and among those who did not perceive public health measures as exaggerated. Private compliance was also associated with personality traits; in particular, individuals who followed regulations and recommendations were likely to be more introverted, conscientious, open, and agreeable. Compliance at work related to both private compliance and colleagues' behaviors. Individuals whose private compliance was high also complied at work. However, when private compliance was low, compliance at work aligned with colleagues’ behaviors; that is, compliance at work was high when colleagues complied and low when they did not. The observed effects were stable over time. In summary, they suggest that compliance with regulations and recommendations depends on individual risk perception, trust in government, perception of required or recommended measures, and social norms. To promote protective behaviors in contexts where larger groups gather (including workplaces), making positive social norms more salient (e.g., by supporting role models) may prove especially useful.","tags":["COVID-19","Compliance","Social norms","Workplace behavior","Organizational behavior","Work safety"],"title":"From delta to omicron: The role of individual factors and social context in self-reported compliance with pandemic regulations and recommendations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelique Burdinski","Benjamin F.

The potential threat posed by the rapid spread of this variant in Germany remained, at the time, elusive. We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) infectious disease model. The model was calibrated on the observed fixation dynamics of the Omicron variant in December 2021, and allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs) and the efficacy of contact reduction strategies. A maximum median incidence of approximately 300 000 (50% PI in 1000: [181,454], 95% PI in 1000: [55,804]) reported cases per day was expected with the median peak occurring in the mid of February 2022, reaching a cumulative Omicron case count of 16.5 million (50% PI in mio: [11.4, 21.3], 95% PI in mio: [4.1, 27.9]) until Apr 1, 2022. These figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid February (peak: 191k daily new cases) and mid March (peak: 230k daily new cases), cumulatively infecting 14.8 million individuals during the study period. The model peak incidence was observed to be highly sensitive to variations in the assumed generation time and decreased with shorter generation time. Low contact reductions were expected to lead to containment.

The potential threat posed by the rapid spread of this variant in Germany remained, at the time, elusive. We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) infectious disease model. The model was calibrated on the observed fixation dynamics of the Omicron variant in December 2021, and allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs) and the efficacy of contact reduction strategies. A maximum median incidence of approximately 300 000 (50% PI in 1000: [181,454], 95% PI in 1000: [55,804]) reported cases per day was expected with the median peak occurring in the mid of February 2022, reaching a cumulative Omicron case count of 16.5 million (50% PI in mio: [11.4, 21.3], 95% PI in mio: [4.1, 27.9]) until Apr 1, 2022. These figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid February (peak: 191k daily new cases) and mid March (peak: 230k daily new cases), cumulatively infecting 14.8 million individuals during the study period. The model peak incidence was observed to be highly sensitive to variations in the assumed generation time and decreased with shorter generation time. Low contact reductions were expected to lead to containment.

Most recently, mobility data was extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic to study the effects of governmental policies and to inform epidemic models. Large-scale mobility is often measured using digital tools such as mobile phones. However, it remains an open question how truthfully these digital proxies represent the actual travel behavior of the general population. Here, we examine mobility datasets from multiple countries and identify two fundamentally different types of bias caused by unequal access to, and unequal usage of mobile phones. We introduce the concept of data generation bias, a previously overlooked type of bias, which is present when the amount of data that an individual produces influences their representation in the dataset. We find evidence for data generation bias in all examined datasets in that high-wealth individuals are overrepresented, with the richest 20% contributing over 50% of all recorded trips, substantially skewing the datasets. This inequality is consequential, as we find mobility patterns of different wealth groups to be structurally different, where the mobility networks of high-wealth users are denser and contain more long-range connections. To mitigate the skew, we present a framework to debias data and show how simple techniques can be used to increase representativeness. Using our approach we show how biases can severely impact outcomes of dynamic processes such as epidemic simulations, where biased data incorrectly estimates the severity and speed of disease transmission. Overall, we show that a failure to account for biases can have detrimental effects on the results of studies and urge researchers and practitioners to account for data-fairness in all future studies of human mobility.","tags":["human mobility","disease dynamics","complex networks","mobility networks","pandemics","epidemics"],"title":"Biases in human mobility data impact epidemic modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin F.

Die Ergebnisse spiegeln nicht die Situation der Omicron-Welle (SARS-CoV-2-Variante B.1.1.529) Anfang 2022 wieder.\nImpfungen gehören du den wirksamsten Mitteln der Pandemiebekämpfung. Trotzdem sind die Impfraten im deutschsprachigen Europa aktuell viel zu niedrig für eine effektive Eindämmung des Virus. In Deutschland waren am 22.11.2021 68% doppelt geimpft, obwohl das RKI bereits im Juli 2021 empfahl, 85% der 12-59-Jährigen und 90% der Über-60-Jährigen zu impfen. Ähnlich schlecht sieht es in Österreich (65% vollständig geimpft) und der Schweiz (66%) aus. Auffrischungsimpfungen (Booster) zur Erhöhung der Impfeffektivität sind seit November in Deutschland empfohlen.\nNeue Berechnungen auf der Basis eines mathematischen Ansteckungsmodells 1 zeigen, dass eine effektive Erhöhung der Impfquote jedoch dringend notwendig ist: bei 8 bis 9 von 10 Ansteckungen mit COVID-19 ist mindestens eine ungeimpfte Person beteiligt. Das folgende Beispiel illustriert, dass aktuell der Großteil der Neuinfektionen durch fehlenden Impfschutz verursacht wird, obwohl ungeimpfte Personen nur ca. 32% der Bevölkerung ausmachen.\nDie Abbildung zeigt, wie ungeimpfte und geimpfte Personen anteilig an der Verbreitung von COVID-19 beteiligt sind (laut Modellschätzungen). Man stelle sich eine Gruppe von Infizierten vor. Angenommen, diese Gruppe hat 100 Ansteckungen verursacht. In der oberen Grafik (A) wird eine Impfeffektivität von 72% bei Erwachsenen und 92% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen angenommen. Dann sehen die 100 Ansteckungen folgendermaßen aus: 51 von den 100 Angesteckten sind Ungeimpfte, die von anderen Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. 25 sind Geimpfte, die von Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. Es wurden also 76 Personen von Ungeimpften angesteckt. Der Anteil der Leute, der durch Geimpfte angesteckt wird, ist erheblich kleiner: 15 Angesteckte sind Ungeimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden und 9 sind Geimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden. Es wurden also lediglich 24 Personen von Geimpften angesteckt. 91 von 100 Ansteckungen entstehen mit Beteiligung mindestens einer Person ohne Impfschutz.\nUm zu verstehen, ob neue Ansteckungen auch durch fehlenden Impfschutz getrieben werden, wenn die Impfung nur eine geringe Effektivität hat, wurde in einem zweiten Beispiel eine geringere Impfeffektivität angenommen 2. In der unteren Grafik wird eine Impfeffektivität von 50% bei über 60ig-Jährigen, 60% bei Erwachsenen bis 59 Jahren und 60% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bis 17 Jahren angenommen. Dann sehen die 100 Infektionen folgendermaßen aus: 38 von den 100 Angesteckten sind Ungeimpfte, die von anderen Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. 29 sind Geimpfte, die von Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. Es wurden also 67 Personen von Ungeimpften angesteckt. Der Anteil der Leute, der durch Geimpfte angesteckt wird, ist erheblich kleiner: 17 Angesteckte sind Ungeimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden und 16 sind Geimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden. Es wurden also lediglich 33 Neuinfizierte von Geimpften angesteckt. 84 von 100 Ansteckungen entstehen mit Beteiligung mindestens einer Person ohne Impfschutz.\nDaraus ergibt sich: An 8 bis 9 von 10 Ansteckungen sind Personen ohne Impfschutz beteiligt. Je effektiver der Impfschutz, desto weniger Ansteckungen werden durch geimpfte Personen verursacht. Die Dynamik der Pandemie wird aktuell also stark durch fehlenden oder nachlassenden, weniger effektiven Impfschutz getrieben.\nDaher empfiehlt sich: Impfquote effektiv erhöhen. Effektivität des Impfschutzes erhöhen, z.B. durch Boostern. Kontakte reduzieren, v.a. zwischen ungeimpften Personen. Ohne zusätzliche Maßnahmen ist keine baldige Besserung der Impfquote zu erwarten, da die Zuwachsrate der Impfkampagne seit Juni 2021 stagniert. Für zusätzliche Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der Impfquote besteht die Herausforderung, dass ein Großteil der ungeimpften Personen schwer erreichbar ist - z.B. laut der COSMO-Studie sind 30% der Ungeimpften zögerlich, 54% sagen, sie wollen sich auf keinen Fall impfen lassen (Stand November 2021). Vor- und Nachteile eine Impfpflicht sollten diskutiert werden. Maßnahmen, die schnell die Kontakte reduzieren, sollten zum Brechen der 4. Welle implementiert werden, da selbst ein schneller Anstieg der Impfrate erst mittelfristig weitere Wellen verhindern, nicht aber die aktuelle Welle brechen kann.\nKontakt: bfmaier@physik.hu-berlin.de\nPreprint: Germany’s current COVID-19 crisis is mainly driven by the unvaccinated\nDas theoretische Framework hinter diesen Berechnungen heisst Contribution Matrix.

Über die tatsächliche Impfeffektivität besteht wissenschaftliche Unsicherheit. Daher werden zwei verschiedene Szenarien angenommen. In Szenario A wird eine hohe Impfeffektivität von 92% bei Kindern und 72% bei Erwachsenen angenommen. Dies entspricht den Effektivitäten der Periode Oktober 2021 für symptomatisches COVID-19 (RKI Situationsbericht vom 11.11.2021). Im Modell werden jedoch Impfeffektivitäten gegen Infektion angenommen, die üblicherweise geringer sind als gegen symptomatisches COVID-19. Diese Effektivitätsschätzung ist daher eine optimistische Schätzung und dient dies als mögliche Obergrenze. Die niedrigeren Impfeffktivitäten gegen Infektion (Szenario B) sind in Übereinstimmung mit Daten aus Großbritannien gewählt (50% bei über 60ig-Jährigen, 60% bei Erwachsenen bis 59 Jahren und 60% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bis 17 Jahren). In Großbritannien wurde vorwiegend mit AstraZeneca geimpft. Dieser Impfstoff gilt in der Literatur als weniger effektiv. Daher dienen diese Werte im Modell als Schätzung für niedrige Impfeffektivität gegen Infektion. Die Ansteckungs-Zahlen beschreiben die geschätzten Anteile der Infektionswege an der totalen effektiven Reproduktionszahl (Reff).

One possible response is to raise awareness for and resilience against such manipulative strategies through psychological inoculation. Two online experiments (total ) demonstrated that a short, simple intervention prompting participants to reflect on an attribute of their own personality—by completing a short personality questionnaire—boosted their ability to accurately identify ads that were targeted at them by up to 26 percentage points. Accuracy increased even without personalized feedback, but merely providing a description of the targeted personality dimension did not improve accuracy.

Inspired by empirical findings on social interaction dynamics, we consider agents characterized by heterogeneous activities and homophily. We show that the transition between a global consensus and emerging radicalized states is mostly governed by social influence and by the controversialness of the topic discussed. Compared with empirical data of polarized debates on Twitter, the model qualitatively reproduces the observed relation between users' engagement and opinions, as well as opinion segregation in the interaction network.

To identify possible transmission routes, we applied combined genomics and contact-network modeling to retrospectively evaluate routine VRE screening data generated by the infection control program of a hemato-oncology unit. Over 1 year, a total of 111 VRE isolates from 111 patients were collected by anal swabs in a tertiary care hospital in Southern Germany. All isolated VRE were whole-genome sequenced, followed by different in-depth bioinformatics analyses including genotyping and determination of phylogenetic relations, aiming to evaluate a standardized workflow. Patient movement data were used to overlay sequencing data to infer transmission events and strain dynamics over time. A predominant clone harboring vanB and exhibiting genotype ST117/CT469 (n = 67) was identified. Our comprehensive combined analyses suggested intra-hospital spread, especially of clone ST117/CT469, despite of extensive screening, single room placement, and contact isolation. A new interactive tool to visualize these complex data was designed. Furthermore, a patient-contact network-modeling approach was developed, which indicates both the periodic import of the clone into the hospital and its spread within the hospital due to patient movements. The analyzed spread of VRE was most likely due to placement of patients in the same room prior to positivity of screening. We successfully demonstrated the added value for this combined strategy to extract well-founded knowledge from interdisciplinary data sources. The combination of patient-contact modeling and high-resolution typing unraveled the transmission dynamics within the hospital department and, additionally, a constant VRE influx over time.","tags":["contact networks","complex networks","antibiotic resistance"],"title":"Comprehensive integrated NGS-based surveillance and contact-network modeling unravels transmission dynamics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a high-risk population within a tertiary care hospital","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024271,"objectID":"bca1094d988a5a4b6fded9c2571a2aad","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2020-digitale/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:11.288512Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2020-digitale/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital epidemiology is a new and rapidly growing field.

Standing as an example, Bayesian multidimensional scaling (MDS) can help scientists learn viral trajectories through space-time, but its computational burden prevents its wider use. Crucial MDS model calculations scale quadratically in the number of observations. We partially mitigate this limitation through massive parallelization using multi-core central processing units, instruction-level vectorization and graphics processing units (GPUs). Fitting the MDS model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, GPUs can deliver more than 100-fold speedups over serial calculations and thus extend Bayesian MDS to a big data setting. To illustrate, we employ Bayesian MDS to infer the rate at which different seasonal influenza virus subtypes use worldwide air traffic to spread around the globe. We examine 5392 viral sequences and their associated 14 million pairwise distances arising from the number of commercial airline seats per year between viral sampling locations. To adjust for shared evolutionary history of the viruses, we implement a phylogenetic extension to the MDS model and learn that subtype H3N2 spreads most effectively, consistent with its epidemic success relative to other seasonal influenza subtypes. Finally, we provide MassiveMDS, an open-source, stand-alone C++ library and rudimentary R package, and discuss program design and high-level implementation with an emphasis on important aspects of computing architecture that become relevant at scale.","tags":["Bayesian","phylogeography"],"title":"Massive parallelization boosts big Bayesian multidimensional scaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","B Mørch Mønsted","P Hövel","S Lehmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1552608000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548865867,"objectID":"247d994917a37365f227b1dc89021d0d","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2019-accelerating/","publishdate":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2019-accelerating/","section":"publication","summary":"With news pushed to smart phones in real time and social media reactions spreading across the globe in seconds, the public discussion can appear accelerated and temporally fragmented.

The question of why modular hierarchical (MH) organizations are so ubiquitous in nature, however, has received less attention. One hypothesis is that MH topologies may provide an optimal structure for certain dynamical processes. We revisit a MH network model that interpolates, using a single parameter, between two known network topologies: from strong hierarchical modularity to an Erdős–Rényi random connectivity structure. We show that this model displays a similar small-world effect as the Kleinberg model, where the connection probability between nodes decays algebraically with distance. We find that there is an optimal structure, in both models, for which the pair-averaged first passage time (FPT) and mean cover time of a discrete-time random walk are minimal, and provide a heuristic explanation for this effect. Finally, we show that analytic predictions for the pair-averaged FPT based on an effective medium approximation fail to reproduce these minima, which implies that their presence is due to a network structure effect.","tags":["complex networks","random walks","first passage time"],"title":"Modular hierarchical and power-law small-world networks bear structural optima for minimal first passage times and cover time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":null,"content":"Complex Systems in Biology, Winter 2022 Complex Systems in Biology, Winter 2021 ","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/courses/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"sdölfkasdölfk.","tags":null,"title":"Courses \u0026 Teaching","type":"page"},{"authors":["G Polo","C Mera Acosta","M B Labruna","F Ferreira","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611770683,"objectID":"b016b6c41eb0747d7de4da3d010eaf1f","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/polo-2018-host/","publishdate":"2021-01-27T18:04:43.135094Z","relpermalink":"/publication/polo-2018-host/","section":"publication","summary":"There are a huge number of pathogens with multi-component transmission cycles, involving amplifier hosts, vectors or complex pathogen life cycles. These complex systems present challenges in terms of modeling and policy development. A lethal tick-borne infectious disease, the Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), is a relevant example of that. The current increase of human cases of BSF has been associated with the presence and expansion of the capybara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, amplifier host for the agent Rickettsia rickettsii and primary host for the tick vector Amblyomma sculptum. We introduce a stochastic dynamical model that captures the spatial distribution of capybaras and ticks to gain a better understanding of the spatial spread of the R. rickettsii and potentially predict future epidemic outcomes. We implemented a reaction-diffusion process in which individuals were divided into classes denoting their state with respect to the disease. The model considered bidirectional movements between base and destination locations limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. We performed systematic stochastic simulations and numerical analysis of the model and investigate the impact of potential interventions to mitigate the spatial spread of the disease. The mobility of capybaras and their attached ticks was significantly influenced by the birth rate of capybaras and therefore, disease propagation velocity was higher in places with higher carrying capacity. Some geographical barriers, generated for example by riparian reforesting, can impede the spatial spread of BSF. The results of this work will allow the formulation of public actions focused on the prevention of BSF human cases.","tags":["Rickettsia rickettsii","infectious disease dynamics","mobility"],"title":"Hosts mobility and spatial spread of Rickettsia rickettsii","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024269,"objectID":"e62c26c741f7973950687af8e398ba8c","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2018-human/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:09.118628Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2018-human/","section":"publication","summary":"Disease dynamics is a complex phenomenon and in order to address these questions expertises from many disciplines need to be integrated.

Based on the global mean first-passage time of target nodes, we derive a method for computing the cumulative distribution function of the cover time based on first-passage time statistics.

The model is a natural extension of the traditional susceptible-infected-susceptible model used for modeling single contagion processes. We show that cooperativity changes the dynamics of the system considerably when cooperativity is strong. The system exhibits discontinuous phase transitions not observed in single agent contagion, multi-stability, a separation of the traditional epidemic threshold into different thresholds for inception and extinction as well as hysteresis. These properties are robust and are corroborated by stochastic simulations on lattices and generic network topologies. Finally, we investigate wave propagation and transients in a spatially extended version of the model and show that especially for intermediate values of baseline reproduction ratios the system is characterized by various types of wave-front speeds. The system can exhibit spatially heterogeneous stationary states for some parameters and negative front speeds(receding wave fronts). The two agent model can be employed as a starting point for more complex contagion processes, involving several interacting agents, a model framework particularly suitable for modeling the spread and dynamics of microbiological ecosystems in host populations.","tags":["infectious disease dynamics","complex contagion","co-infection"],"title":"Fundamental properties of cooperative contagion processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Santibanez","J M Hübschen","M C Ben Mamou","M Muscat","K E Brown","R Myers","O Donoso Mantke","H Zeichhardt","Dirk Brockmann","S V Shulga","C.P.Muller","P M O'Connor","M N Mulders","A Mankertz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024269,"objectID":"f3d323b1d1cbe15266367e36dabfc468","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/santibanez-2017-molecular/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:08.915559Z","relpermalink":"/publication/santibanez-2017-molecular/","section":"publication","summary":"The WHO European Region (EUR) has adopted the goal of eliminating measles and rubella but individual countries perform differently in achieving this goal.

We find that, in line with other temporal characterizations of human activity, the signing process is typically non-Poissonian and non-homogeneous in time. However, this process exhibits anomalously high memory for human activity, possibly indicating that synchronized external influence or contagion play and important role. More interestingly, we find clear differences in the characteristics of the inter-event time distributions depending on the total number of signatures that petitions receive, independently of the total duration of the petitions. Specifically, popular petitions that attract a large volume of signatures exhibit more variance in the distribution of inter-event times than unpopular petitions with only a few signatures, which could be considered an indication that the former are more bursty. However, petitions with large signature volume are less bursty according to measures that consider the time ordering of inter-event times.

Responding to the demand for connectivity, innovative third-party players have proposed solutions that have been widely adopted by field users of the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay. The experience associated with the utilisation of these systems, which facilitate the monitoring of wide laboratory networks, stressed the need for a more global and comprehensive approach to diagnostic connectivity.

This challenge is particularly pronounced at early stages of tumor formation, when experimental observation is most limited. Elucidating such interactions could inform both understanding of cancer and clinical practice. To address this need we developed a computational model capturing the current understanding of how individual metastatic tumor cells and immune cells sense and contribute to the tumor environment, which in turn enabled us to investigate the complex, collective behavior of these systems. Surprisingly, we discovered that tumor escape from immune control was enhanced by the existence of small differences (or heterogeneities) in the responses of individual immune cells to their environment, as well as by heterogeneities in the way that cells and the molecules they secrete are arranged in space. These conclusions held true over a range of model formulations, suggesting that this is a general feature of these tumor-immune networks. Finally, we used this model as a test bed to evaluate potential strategies for enhancing immunological control of early tumors, ultimately predicting that specifically modulating tumor-associated immune dysfunction may be more effective than simply enhanced tumor killing.","tags":["cancer","dynamical systems"],"title":"Spatial and functional heterogeneities shape collective behavior of tumor-immune networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Manitz","T Kneib","M Schlather","D Helbing","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024266,"objectID":"6a294bb410680f7b3fdd7f6b2a342e08","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/manitz-2014-origin/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:06.293042Z","relpermalink":"/publication/manitz-2014-origin/","section":"publication","summary":"The key challenge during food-borne disease outbreaks, e.g. the 2011 EHEC/HUS outbreak in Germany, is the design of efficient mitigation strategies based on a timely identification of the outbreak's spatial origin.

These methods are time-consuming and suffer from biased data collected slowly in patient interviews. Here we apply a recently developed, network-theoretical method to identify the spatial origin of food-borne disease outbreaks. Thereby, the network captures the transportation routes of contaminated foods. The technique only requires spatial information on case reports regularly collected by public health institutions and a model for the underlying food distribution network. The approach is based on the idea of replacing the conventional geographic distance with an effective distance that is derived from the topological structure of the underlying food distribution network.

In the face of these data, researchers often employ methods to extract reduced networks containing the most important structures or pathways, sometimes known as ‘skeletons’ or ‘backbones’. Numerous such methods have been developed. Yet data are often noisy or incomplete, with unknown numbers of missing or spurious links. Relatively little effort has gone into understanding how salient network extraction methods perform in the face of noisy or incomplete networks. We study this problem by comparing how the salient features extracted by two popular methods change when networks are perturbed, either by deleting nodes or links, or by randomly rewiring links. Our results indicate that simple, global statistics for skeletons can be accurately inferred even for noisy and incomplete network data, but it is crucial to have complete, reliable data to use the exact topologies of skeletons or backbones. These results also help us understand how skeletons respond to damage to the network itself, as in an attack scenario.","tags":["complex networks","network salience"],"title":"Robustness of skeletons and salient features in networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024266,"objectID":"7d7d57306bc6435594fadae7e7eaae6f","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2014-understanding/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:31:06.435595Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2014-understanding/","section":"publication","summary":"The emergence and global spread of human infectious diseases has become one of the most serious public health threats of the 21st century.

The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic–mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times.

They influence the interregional flow of information and cross-border trade and affect the diffusion of innovation and technology. However, it is unclear if existing administrative subdivisions that typically evolved decades ago still reflect the most plausible organizational structure of today. The complexity of modern human communication, the ease of long-distance movement, and increased interaction across political borders complicate the operational definition and assessment of geographic borders that optimally reflect the multi-scale nature of today's human connectivity patterns. What border structures emerge directly from the interplay of scales in human interactions is an open question. Based on a massive proxy dataset, we analyze a multi-scale human mobility network and compute effective geographic borders inherent to human mobility patterns in the United States. We propose two computational techniques for extracting these borders and for quantifying their strength. We find that effective borders only partially overlap with existing administrative borders, and show that some of the strongest mobility borders exist in unexpected regions. We show that the observed structures cannot be generated by gravity models for human traffic. Finally, we introduce the concept of link significance that clarifies the observed structure of effective borders. Our approach represents a novel type of quantitative, comparative analysis framework for spatially embedded multi-scale interaction networks in general and may yield important insight into a multitude of spatiotemporal phenomena generated by human activity.","tags":["human mobility","complex networks","modularity","geographic borders"],"title":"The structure of borders in a small world","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612024257,"objectID":"b99f2f6db25b7b92bdc26dc6fd24b008","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2009-human/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T16:30:57.806296Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2009-human/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["human mobility","infectious disease dynamics","random walks","anomalous diffusion","lévy flights"],"title":"Human mobility and spatial disease dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann","L Hufnagel","T Geisel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1138233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1138233600,"objectID":"9b4103c0b399b726137aec51701ee79c","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/brockmann-2006-scaling/","publishdate":"2021-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brockmann-2006-scaling/","section":"publication","summary":"The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic10, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Lévy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.","tags":["human mobility","scaling laws","anomalous diffusion"],"title":"The scaling laws of human travel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Hufnagel","Dirk Brockmann","T Geisel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1098144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1098144000,"objectID":"ba3cc9ad592522334c00eb03f32cacd2","permalink":"https://synosys.github.io/publication/hufnagel-2004-forecast/","publishdate":"2021-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hufnagel-2004-forecast/","section":"publication","summary":"The rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome demonstrated the potential threat an infectious disease poses in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.
