      <title>Clonal Interference in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/clonal_interference/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our research group explores the intricate relationship between complex environmental structures and evolutionary processes, focusing on clonal interference in asexual populations. We aim to understand how organisms adapt in heterogeneous, network-like environments that closely resemble real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clonal interference (CI) occurs in asexual populations when multiple beneficial mutations arise and compete, unable to combine through recombination. While CI has been studied in well-mixed or simple spatial structures, its behavior in complex, heterogeneous environments remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;optional_cool.gif&#34; alt=&#34;cool gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Research Aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding CI in Highly Heterogeneous Environments: We investigate how diverse network topologies influence clonal interference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying Key Structural Components: We aim to pinpoint specific elements of network structures that significantly impact adaptive processes, understanding which features promote faster adaptation and which areas are likely sources of adaptive mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaping and Controlling Adaptive Evolution: By understanding how network structures influence evolution, we seek to develop strategies for potentially guiding adaptive processes in complex environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing Analytical Tools: We&amp;rsquo;re working to create and refine mathematical and computational tools that effectively model and predict evolutionary dynamics in intricate systems, bridging network theory, evolutionary biology, and complex systems science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights gained from our research have potential applications across a wide range of fields. In epidemiology, our understanding of how pathogens evolve in structured host populations could form more effective disease management strategies. Conservation biologists might use our findings to guide habitat management practices, supporting species adaptation and resilience in fragmented environments. Our work could also lead to improved bioprocess designs by accounting for how environmental structure affects microbial evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these direct applications, the principles we uncover might have broader, more speculative implications. For instance, our approaches to mutation spread in biological networks could provide insights into how content goes viral on social media platforms with diverse user structures. The competition between genetic strains in our research might elucidate how ideas, innovations and cultural practices propagate through social and professional networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to explore the intricate interplay between network complexity and evolutionary dynamics, we&amp;rsquo;re not merely advancing theoretical knowledge. We&amp;rsquo;re developing a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how adaptation occurs in complex systems. This research has the potential to open new avenues for managing and harnessing evolutionary processes in various fields, spanning from biology to the social sciences. By bridging the gap between network theory and evolutionary biology, we&amp;rsquo;re paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of how information – be it genetic, cultural, or technological – spreads and competes in our interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fungal Growth</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/project/fungal_growth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fungi interact in a mycorrhizal symbiosis with plants or are simple decomposers of organic matter.
In this project, we investigate the growth of filamentous fungi by creating and investigating mathematical growth models.
We cooperate with experimental biologists from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aguilar-ecology.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;aguilar ecology lab&lt;/a&gt; who have a profound knowledge of the growth patterns of different fungal species (see Fig.1).
In a first &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ismecommun/article/2/1/2/7460968&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;network analysis of our collaborators&lt;/a&gt;, they identified that some network traits vary most in between species, as for example the meshedness (how different the network is from a fully-connected one without crossing edges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/2022Aguilar_network_paper_fig3adapted.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.1 - Different species of hyphal growing fungi and the reconstruction of the network they are forming.
  Figure is adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ismecommun/article/2/1/2/7460968&#34;&gt;Aguilar-Trigueros et al. (2022)&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We address the problem from a modeling perspective, that means we build an agent-based model, which is motivated from real fungi.
In our model each agent represents the tip of a hyphen and the tip as well as the whole hyphen release an enzyme.
This enzyme diffuses though the environment and other tips/agents can sense the local concentration and gradient.
This is all the information the tip has about its environment, i.e. only local information is allowed.
New Tips/Agents are created either by an apical branching event, at which one tip splits in two, or by a lateral branching event, where from the lower half of a tip compartment multiple branches grow perpendicular to the local growth direction.
By varying some fundamental parameters of the model as the diffusion coefficient, the enzyme release rate or the number of lateral branches, different shapes can emerge as shown if Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/3_mycel_compilation.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;1200&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.2 -
  Depending on the parameters, the mycelium grows densely (A) or less densely (B, C) if for example the enzyme release rate is increased (B)  or the septation rule is adapted (C). The enzyme in the environment (orange and red background color) inhibits the growth of the mycelium, thus the mycelium is more responsive to its own form (compare A with B). In (A, B) the septation and lateral branching form always two septa and branches at each septation event. In (C) 6 septa and branches are formed during a septation event. While the quadrants 2-4 show the concentration on a variable linear scale (bottom color bar), the 1st quadrant uses a fixed logarithmic scale (top color bar) to enable a fair comparison between simulations.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goals are now to reproduce key structural properties of real fungal species with a model as simple as possible, study the statistical properties of the different phases of the model and what task the fungi can perform beast at every phase.
This is exciting, especially because we are able to switch between theory, modelling and experiments.
The big picture is of course the role of the fungi in the ecosystems in connection with their growth strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Import Risk</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/project/import_risk/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our globalized world is strongly connected, on the small scale by buses, trains, cars, and on the largest, global scale by the Worldwide Air transportation Network (WAN).
It is likely that our connectivity has not reached its peak yet, since for example the number of globally scheduled air passengers increased yearly by about 6% between 2004 and 2019.
The connectivity has immense consequences on the propagation of disease since alongside passengers everything that sticks to them, such as bacteria, viruses, earth clumps beneath their shoes etc. comes with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project crosses the fields of network science, transportation, mobility and disease dynamics and it&amp;rsquo;s an offspring of the idea to not use the conventional distance (in meter, miles, feet &amp;hellip; pick your unit) as a metric but an &lt;strong&gt;effective distance&lt;/strong&gt; that is based on the mobility between regions.
When - $P(B | A)$ is the probability to travel to B from A (which is computed from mobility fluxes) than the effective distance is $ d _{\text{eff}} (A | B) = d_0 - log (P(i| n_0)) $ -.
In the seminal paper by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brockmann and Helbing (2013)&lt;/a&gt; _effective distance $d _{\text{eff}}$ - was shown to linearly correlate with the arrival time of diseases as shown in Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/eff_dist_paper_adapted_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;Full&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 2 - The shortest path tree based on the &lt;b&gt;effective distance&lt;/b&gt; with the airport of Hong Kong as origin (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and how a pandemic spreads around the globe (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;).
  While the spread on the world map seems rather random, you see a nice circular wave spreading in the effective distance tree, illustrating the linear correlation to disease arrival times.
  Adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200&#34;&gt;Brockmann and Helbing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recent paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser et al. (2024),&lt;/a&gt; we deepen the connection between the effective distance shortest path tree, spreading dynamics and mobility.
We present a way to estimate the passenger flow between any two airports (including those without direct connections) given that we only know the number and maximal capacity of planes (see illustrative example in Fig. 3).
In the end, the method allows us to estimate the number of infected passenger leaving B when we know the number of infected that entered A.
Thus, we know the risk of importation and why it is named &lt;b&gt;import risk method&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/relrisk.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 3 - Import Risk Example: 100 infected passengers board planes at airport X en route to destination airports elsewhere in the network, going through transit airports in the process. The relative import risk at a given destination is the fraction of the 100 individuals that entered at airport X and exited at that destination airport (red).
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic idea behind the import risk method is to let a random walker start at node B of the WAN and exit at each node with a probability derived from the effective distance shortest path tree.
The final fraction of times it leaves at node A is the import risk probability.
Now, this method is parameter free and motivated by disease dynamics, but at the same time it provides a method to estimate mobility on a global scale.
The mobility estimation is a classic task in transportation science with well-established models as the gravity model (proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2087063?casa_token=5goDmVg4aOkAAAAA%3A6Y9zup7UcSjT8DQ1izhRza_-N568nGLP_43ikQys0Vzoux-4qaYKp1u0Cruz2YwZ2hggPU2PIKW4oqbB6xnFtaJIgj-oX_zCbMwLneoPv8OzCdsFXA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1946 by Zipf&lt;/a&gt;).
A core aspect of our import risk paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser et al. (2024)&lt;/a&gt; is to compare our method to established mobility models.
We found that our approach outperforms the established models, and the crazy thing is, that our method is parameter free, while the gravity model always needs parameter estimation (one needs to know the real mobility flow beforehand).
This holds true if we check the prediction quality for the 10 countries with the highest import probability, which is especially important for disease propagation since these countries are the one that should increase their passenger control (shown in Fig. 4).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./figures/ir_paper_fig_10cntrs.png&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;800&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Fig. 4 - Mobility model comparisons for top 10 import countries: The well-established gravity model with exponential (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and power-law (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) distance decay, the parameter free radiation model (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;) and our import risk model (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;).
  Each dot is a country that is among the 10 countries with the highest import probability from another country (10 target countries x 183 source countries).
  A true or false positive (T.Pos. or F. Pos.) means that the country is or is not among the 10 countries with the highest reference import probability.
  A false negative (F. Neg.) means that it belongs according to reference it is among the top 10 but was not detected by the respective model.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied the measure during COVID-19 to estimate the countries that have been reached by Omicron without it being detected &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/reports/importrisk_omicron_update/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
And in a big cooperation with great colleagues that have been put together by &lt;a href=&#34;https://manliodedomenico.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manlio De Domenico,&lt;/a&gt; we have developed and validated a framework (&lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/6/pgad192/7191545?login=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klamser and d&amp;rsquo;Andrea et al. (2023)&lt;/a&gt;)that can estimate from sparse and noisy samples via phylogenetic analysis the time when the variant first occurred in the country of origin, how it spreads across the globe with our import risk model, and how the countries are affected by a disease dynamic model.
We were even able to smash everything into one number, which we call the &lt;strong&gt;pandemic delay&lt;/strong&gt;, that estimates how long it takes for a new emerging variant to make out 10% of all current cases in a respective country.
It revealed that only by combining mobility data with a phylogenetic estimate of the reproduction number, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly
assessed relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New paper out: Germany’s fourth COVID-19 wave was mainly driven by the unvaccinated</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/role_of_vaccinated/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/role_of_vaccinated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00176-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we use a recently developed approach (the contribution matrix method) in combination with epidemiological data to estimate the contribution of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations to the current COVID-19 effective reproduction number &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; in Germany. We find that a substantial fraction of reproduction is caused by unvaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pdf of the paper is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00176-7.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of the German population was fully vaccinated at the time (about 65%), COVID-19 incidence started growing exponentially in October 2021 with about 41% of recorded new cases aged twelve or above being symptomatic breakthrough infections, presumably also contributing to the dynamics. So far, it remained elusive how significant this contribution was and whether targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may have stopped the amplification of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;methods&#34;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We develop and introduce a contribution matrix approach based on the next-generation matrix of a population-structured compartmental infectious disease model to derive contributions of respective inter- and intragroup infection pathways of unvaccinated and vaccinated subpopulations to the effective reproduction number and new infections, considering empirical data of vaccine efficacies against infection and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we show that about 61%–76% of all new infections were caused by unvaccinated individuals and only 24%–39% were caused by the vaccinated. Furthermore, 32%–51% of new infections were likely caused by unvaccinated infecting other unvaccinated. Decreasing the transmissibility of the unvaccinated by, e. g. targeted NPIs, causes a steeper decrease in the effective reproduction number R than decreasing the transmissibility of vaccinated individuals, potentially leading to temporary epidemic control. Reducing contacts between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals serves to decrease R in a similar manner as increasing vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minority of the German population—the unvaccinated—is assumed to have caused the majority of new infections in the fall of 2021 in Germany. Our results highlight the importance of combined measures, such as vaccination campaigns and targeted contact reductions to achieve temporary epidemic control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;wichtig&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wichtig:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die hier beschriebenen wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse beziehen sich auf die &lt;strong&gt;B.1.617.2&lt;/strong&gt; SARS-CoV-2 Variante (&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Delta&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;) und das Infektionsgeschehen Mitte November in Deutschland. Die Ergebnisse spiegeln nicht die Situation der Omicron-Welle (SARS-CoV-2-Variante &lt;strong&gt;B.1.1.529&lt;/strong&gt;) Anfang 2022 wieder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impfungen gehören du den wirksamsten Mitteln der Pandemiebekämpfung. Trotzdem sind die Impfraten im &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;deutschsprachigen Europa&lt;/a&gt; aktuell viel zu niedrig für eine effektive Eindämmung des Virus. In Deutschland waren am 22.11.2021 68% doppelt geimpft, obwohl das &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH84v28rD0AhWJzKQKHfsXCJUQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;amp;url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2021/27/Art_01.html&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0G9DqJ7ijemGlZYRwXrZbW&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RKI&lt;/a&gt; bereits im Juli 2021 empfahl, 85% der 12-59-Jährigen und 90% der Über-60-Jährigen zu impfen. Ähnlich schlecht sieht es in Österreich (65% vollständig geimpft) und der Schweiz (66%) aus. Auffrischungsimpfungen (Booster) zur Erhöhung der Impfeffektivität sind seit November in Deutschland &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Kommissionen/STIKO/Empfehlungen/PM_2021-11-18.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;empfohlen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neue Berechnungen auf der Basis eines mathematischen Ansteckungsmodells &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; zeigen, dass eine effektive Erhöhung der Impfquote jedoch dringend notwendig ist: bei 8 bis 9 von 10 Ansteckungen mit COVID-19 ist mindestens eine ungeimpfte Person beteiligt. Das folgende Beispiel illustriert, dass aktuell der Großteil der Neuinfektionen durch fehlenden Impfschutz verursacht wird, obwohl ungeimpfte Personen nur ca. 32% der Bevölkerung ausmachen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Abbildung zeigt, wie ungeimpfte und geimpfte Personen anteilig an der Verbreitung von COVID-19 beteiligt sind (laut Modellschätzungen). Man stelle sich eine Gruppe von Infizierten vor. Angenommen, diese Gruppe hat 100 Ansteckungen verursacht. In der oberen Grafik (A) wird eine Impfeffektivität von 72% bei Erwachsenen und 92% bei Kindern und
Jugendlichen angenommen. Dann sehen die 100 Ansteckungen folgendermaßen aus: 51
von den 100 Angesteckten sind Ungeimpfte, die von anderen Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. 25 sind Geimpfte, die von Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. Es wurden also 76 Personen von Ungeimpften angesteckt. Der Anteil der Leute, der durch Geimpfte angesteckt wird, ist erheblich kleiner: 15 Angesteckte sind Ungeimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden und 9 sind Geimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden. Es wurden also lediglich 24 Personen von Geimpften angesteckt. 91 von 100 Ansteckungen entstehen mit Beteiligung mindestens einer Person ohne Impfschutz.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um zu verstehen, ob neue Ansteckungen auch durch fehlenden Impfschutz getrieben werden, wenn die Impfung nur eine geringe Effektivität hat, wurde in einem zweiten Beispiel eine geringere Impfeffektivität angenommen &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In der unteren Grafik wird eine Impfeffektivität von 50% bei über 60ig-Jährigen, 60% bei Erwachsenen bis 59 Jahren und 60% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bis 17 Jahren angenommen. Dann sehen die 100 Infektionen folgendermaßen aus: 38 von den 100 Angesteckten sind Ungeimpfte, die von anderen Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. 29 sind Geimpfte, die von Ungeimpften infiziert wurden. Es wurden also 67 Personen von Ungeimpften angesteckt. Der Anteil der Leute, der durch Geimpfte angesteckt wird, ist erheblich kleiner: 17 Angesteckte sind Ungeimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden und 16 sind Geimpfte, die von Geimpften angesteckt wurden. Es wurden also lediglich 33 Neuinfizierte von Geimpften angesteckt. 84 von 100 Ansteckungen entstehen mit Beteiligung mindestens einer Person ohne Impfschutz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daraus-ergibt-sich&#34;&gt;Daraus ergibt sich:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An 8 bis 9 von 10 Ansteckungen sind Personen ohne Impfschutz beteiligt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Je effektiver der Impfschutz, desto weniger Ansteckungen werden durch geimpfte Personen verursacht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Die Dynamik der Pandemie wird aktuell also stark durch fehlenden oder nachlassenden, weniger effektiven Impfschutz getrieben.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daher-empfiehlt-sich&#34;&gt;Daher empfiehlt sich:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impfquote effektiv erhöhen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effektivität des Impfschutzes erhöhen, z.B. durch Boostern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kontakte reduzieren, v.a. zwischen ungeimpften Personen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohne zusätzliche Maßnahmen ist keine baldige Besserung der Impfquote zu erwarten, da die Zuwachsrate der Impfkampagne seit Juni 2021 &lt;a href=&#34;http://impfdashboard.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;stagniert&lt;/a&gt;. Für zusätzliche Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der Impfquote besteht die Herausforderung, dass ein Großteil der ungeimpften Personen schwer erreichbar ist - z.B. laut der &lt;a href=&#34;https://projekte.uni-erfurt.de/cosmo2020/web/summary/56/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;COSMO-Studie&lt;/a&gt; sind 30% der Ungeimpften zögerlich, 54% sagen, sie wollen sich auf keinen Fall impfen lassen (Stand November 2021). Vor- und Nachteile eine Impfpflicht sollten &lt;a href=&#34;https://psyarxiv.com/pmx3w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;diskutiert werden&lt;/a&gt;. Maßnahmen, die schnell die Kontakte reduzieren, sollten zum Brechen der 4. Welle implementiert werden, da selbst ein schneller Anstieg der Impfrate erst mittelfristig weitere Wellen verhindern, nicht aber die aktuelle Welle brechen kann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Das theoretische Framework hinter diesen Berechnungen heisst Contribution Matrix. Die Berechnungen sind detailliert hier beschrieben: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rocs.hu-berlin.de/publication/maier-2021-germany/maier-2021-germany.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://rocs.hu-berlin.de/publication/maier-2021- germany/maier-2021-germany.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beide Szenarien gehen von folgenden aktuellen Impfraten pro Altersgruppe aus: 0-11 = 0%, 12-17 = 40%, 18-59 = 72%, 60+ = 85%. Über die tatsächliche Impfeffektivität besteht wissenschaftliche Unsicherheit. Daher werden zwei verschiedene Szenarien angenommen. In Szenario A wird eine hohe Impfeffektivität von 92% bei Kindern und 72% bei Erwachsenen angenommen. Dies entspricht den Effektivitäten der Periode Oktober 2021 für symptomatisches COVID-19 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Gesamt.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RKI Situationsbericht vom 11.11.2021&lt;/a&gt;). Im Modell werden jedoch Impfeffektivitäten gegen Infektion angenommen, die üblicherweise geringer sind als gegen symptomatisches COVID-19. Diese Effektivitätsschätzung ist daher eine optimistische Schätzung und dient dies als mögliche Obergrenze. Die niedrigeren Impfeffktivitäten gegen Infektion (Szenario B) sind in Übereinstimmung mit Daten aus Großbritannien gewählt (50% bei über 60ig-Jährigen, 60% bei Erwachsenen bis 59 Jahren und 60% bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bis 17 Jahren). In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm0620&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Großbritannien&lt;/a&gt; wurde vorwiegend mit AstraZeneca geimpft. Dieser Impfstoff gilt in der Literatur als weniger effektiv. Daher dienen diese Werte im Modell als Schätzung für niedrige Impfeffektivität gegen Infektion. Die Ansteckungs-Zahlen beschreiben die geschätzten Anteile der Infektionswege an der totalen effektiven Reproduktionszahl (Reff). Zum Zeitpunkt dieser Berechnungen lag R etwa bei &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/SARS-CoV-2-Nowcasting_und_-R-Schaetzung/blob/main/Nowcast_R_aktuell.csv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1,2&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Monitor: Contact patterns during the Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/contact_monitor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://synosys.github.io/old_news/contact_monitor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to mobility, we now show the average contacts in the population over time—with equally important insights into the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobility of people gives us an important overview of the pandemic, but it is actually the contacts between people that are instrumental in the infection dynamics: Transmissions occur when people meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/contact-index/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contact monitor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we make these contacts visible. The monitor shows the average number of contacts that a person in Germany had on a given day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can clearly see how strongly contacts have decreased in March 2020, and how they are still at a low level more than a year after the start of the pandemic. Also visible are the different phases of the pandemic and reactions to it with lockdowns, relaxations, holidays and vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contacts is calculated from GPS mobile phone data and provided to us as an anonymous, aggregated statistic - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covid-19-mobility.org/data-info/contacts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more on the methodology here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to analyze contact dynamics and investigate what conclusions can be drawn about infection dynamics. For example, in the study &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/31/e2026731118&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ruediger et al.&lt;/a&gt;, contacts were shown to be related to the reproductive number R.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contact Index Monitor</title>

  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a pandemic develops depends on many factors: the biology of the pathogen, its susceptibility to external influences such as humidity and temperature, but most of all it is determined by contacts between individuals: transmissions occur primarily when people have contact with each other. The number of contacts thus gives us an insight into the course of the pandemic. Fewer contacts make it more difficult for the pathogen to spread through the population, whereas more contacts promote rapid spread. In the Contacts Monitor, we show the number of contacts and its variation in Germany over time.&lt;/p&gt;
